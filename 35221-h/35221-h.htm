<p>There are enough people in prison in these United States
to furnish a citizenship to a considerable territory, or to
populate a good-sized city. For the psychological student,
they form the most interesting of all objects of study. For
the philanthropist, and for the Christian missionary, they
constitute a wonderful field of activity. How to lift them
out of the criminal strata is the question to which Mr.
Herr is devoting his life, in an effort to answer. In a good
measure he is answering it. Many prisoners to whom the
grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation, will rise to
call him blessed.&mdash;Rev. Jno. Paul, Mississippi.</p>

<h2><a name="Foreword" id="Foreword"></a>Foreword</h2>


<p>Gathered within these pages are recitals of scenes
and incidents in a field of existence fortunately unfamiliar
to the majority of our readers. The subject
has been handled without any attempt to embellish
the hard facts or gloss over the cruel details&mdash;the paramount
desire upon the part of the author being an
endeavor to show the crying necessity for a constant,
earnest labor among the unfortunates who are shut
away from God's sunshine; whom God still loves, despite
their sins of omission and commission. If the
perusal of this volume brings to the reader a belief
that the cause is worthy, that labor in this field brings
a reward which amply compensates for the time and
effort expended, the author will rest in the knowledge
of a duty well performed. There has been no effort
at exaggeration in presenting these sketches of daily
experiences among the outcasts of society, no straining
for effect, no striving to paint word pictures that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
may touch the heart. It is simply the story of everyday
life in the field of the prison missionary's labor,
and is given to the public with a fervent prayer that
God, in His infinite wisdom, will instill in the hearts
of our readers a feeling of charity toward those whose
burden is almost greater than they can bear.</p>

<h2><a name="Story_of_the_Life_of_Geo_L_Herr" id="Story_of_the_Life_of_Geo_L_Herr"></a>Story of the Life of Geo. L. Herr</h2>


<p>The Rev. George L. Herr, prison evangelist, has received
from Chicago his book entitled "The Story of His
Life," by Edward De Alma. Mr. Herr distributed 100
copies yesterday in the Jefferson County jail, and the men
received them with great eagerness. Mr. Herr will place
the story in all penal institutions. A letter from the Rev.
James M. Taylor, complimenting the book, says: "I have
read with soul-stirring interest the sad, heart-rending experience
of Brother Herr, and the miraculous deliverance
by the grace of God; how, by a life of sin, he squandered a
fortune; how God found him and gave him deliverance;
the romantic way in which his God-given companion entered
his life and how they are being used, perhaps, as no
other persons to-day in helping those behind the bars. This
story will warn the reckless, encourage the 'outcast,' and
put a desire in the hearts of thousands to lead better
lives."&mdash;<i>Louisville Courier-Journal</i></p>

<p>The Rev. Paul, of Meridian, Miss., says: "The story of
Brother Herr's life, 'Redeemed from the depths of sin to
the mountain top of salvation,' is a thrilling narrative, published
as a warning to the fallen."</p>

<p>The Rev. J. B. Foote, chaplain of the Onondaga county
penitentiary, in New York, acknowledging receipt of the
life story of Mr. Herr and thanking him for it, states in his
letter that he will use the book in his preaching in prison.</p>

<p>When asked if prison work paid, Mr. Herr said: "Who
will ever know the vast number that will attribute their
first impulse to a better life, formed while in the seclusion
of a prison cell, while reading this book. The world will
never know how many, when sitting in judgment upon
themselves, have learned the great secret, that it takes an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
omnipotent power to change the current of their lives and
give them deliverance from the power of sin, and enabling
them to go forth, not to live a new purpose, but a new
life."</p>

<p>In 1909 Mr. Herr published 150,000 sermons, books and
tracts.</p>

<p>The Rev. George L. Herr, whose address delivered in
our chapel last Sunday morning was charmingly refreshing,
is a man whose vicissitudes of life lead through a labyrinth
that would require a half century of years to make
its journey at an ordinary pace.&mdash;Rev. D. J. Starr, D.D.,
Ohio Penitentiary.</p>

<p>Bro. Herr knows the prison work as few men do. He is
a man of large sympathy, and having had an experience of
fifteen years as an evangelist, knows how to reach the
hearts of the men. He has the entire confidence of both
prisoners and officials and is always given a most hearty
welcome by all.&mdash;Jos. Severance, Chaplain.</p>

<p>"The large number who have been helped by hearing
your message will be still further benefited by reading your
book."&mdash;Rev. Albert J. Steelman, Ph.D., Chaplain, Illinois
State Penitentiary.</p>

<p>Get Rev. Herr's book for your good, but chiefly for the
good of others.</p>

<p>Rev. C. R. Hemphill, D.D., Louisville, Ky.: "I believe
Rev. George L. Herr especially equipped for the difficult
work of an evangelist to those in prison and to the
neglected."</p>

<p>Rev. Wm. Edmond Foster: "His love for lost souls and
his zeal knows no bounds. I bespeak for him a life of
great usefulness to his fellowmen without hope and without
God."</p>

<p>Rev. Horace G. Ogden, D.D., New York: "I have been
placed where I have known intimately his work as prison
evangelist. I can say he has made a superb record. He
has taken an enlarged field of work, and I have every confidence
in his increased usefulness. His book merits a
large circulation."</p>

<p>Rev. Ed. Ferguson: "For years he, with his most estimable
wife, have given their time and talent to the uplifting
of the down-trodden of this great metropolis and
they have the respect and hearty co-operation of the best
people in Louisville."</p>

<p>Rev. James M. Taylor: "The story will warn the reckless,
encourage the 'outcast,' and put desire in the hearts
of thousands to lead better lives."</p>

<p>Rev. T. T. Taliaferro, Chaplain Kentucky State Prison:
"Your sermons are blessed of God to the furtherance of
the works of grace in our midst. May God bless you in
your noble work."</p>

<p>Rev. W. O. Vreeland, Chaplain Kentucky State Prison:
"You are worthy of the highest commendation."</p>

Church: "Rev. George L. Herr's talk at last Sunday's session

"Who will ever know the vast number that will attribute
their first impulse to a better life, formed while in seclusion
of a prison cell while reading this book."</p>

<p>The Rev. George L. Herr is bringing out a book on prison
life which is abundantly capable of two effects, namely:
Enlisting the attention of readers, like a romance, and benefitting
the class of whom he writes. It is a two-hundred
page book, illustrated with pictures of prisons, and scenes
behind the bars.</p>

<p class="chp">LIFE OF GEORGE L. HERR</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By EDWARD De ALMA</span></p>

<p class="center">A BRAND PLUCKED FROM THE BURNING.</p>

<p class="center">"As we sow so shall we reap."</p>


<p>Born in the city of Louisville, of an old Kentucky family, whose
escutcheon had never been shadowed by smirch or breath of shame or
ignominy, it might truthfully be said of George L. Herr that he had been
ushered into this world with the proverbial "gold spoon in his mouth,"
his father, the late Richard S. Herr, being a prominent and highly
esteemed and wealthy citizen of the grand old state of Kentucky. Though
surrounded by the luxuries of life, by environments unusually favorable
for the development of a strong, healthy, vigorous and clean life, yet
Brother Herr's life from his youth up to the period of this writing,
presents an aspect checkered with the lights and shadows of temptation,
sin, remorse, repentance, redemption and restful peace of heart in
salvation through Jesus.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Give us help from trouble; for vain is the help of man.&mdash;Ps.
108:12.</p>

<p>God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
trouble.&mdash;Ps. 46:1.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>At the age of three months, the death of his precious
mother caused him to be given into the keeping
of his aunt, a noble Christian woman, and it was due
to her teachings that the seeds of reverence for God,
belief in his dearly beloved Son and faith in the
promise of a life of everlasting happiness were
planted deep in the recesses of George Herr's heart,
while his father, a Christian gentleman, spared no
efforts in his endeavor to bring up his son in the way
he should go.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen years, through the death of
his father, he came into the possession of a large estate,
but lacking the experience which usually comes
with maturity, he developed a spirit of independence
which soon brought in its train of attendant evils.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak; O Lord,
heal me.&mdash;Ps. 6:2.</p>

<p>My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made
perfect in weakness.&mdash;2 Cor. 12:9.</p>
</div>

<p>The story of George Herr's experience is the recital
of a man's gradual surrender to the power of drink,
until the enormity of his fall can but be depicted by
contrasting his condition with that as it was a few
years before. Then he was a well known young man of
Louisville's elite society, wealthy, respected, esteemed
and sought after. Friends without number, well
wishers innumerable, the door of any refined home in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the city would have swung wide open in welcome at
his knock. Now the other picture: A drunken outcast,
a prey to the buffetings of every chance wind of fate,
deprived of friends, stripped of wealth, position and
reputation; exposed to every form of evil, subject to
the cruelty of every character of temptation that assails
human nature. Ostracized from society, barred
from contact with any self-respecting acquaintance of
former days, can you imagine a more potent example
of the victory of Satan through the agency of his chief
field marshal, Drink? God grant that this may come
as a warning to some one of the thousands of young
men who, with prospects as bright or even more flattering
than were those of George Herr at the age of
eighteen, are at this moment entering upon the path
which will lead them, as it has countless thousands,
into the abyss of eternal destruction! God grant that
the moral to be drawn from this picture will burn itself
in indelible letters of fire upon the very soul of
each young man who reads this.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>I am poor and needy; make haste unto me, O God.&mdash;Ps.
70:5.</p>

<p>My God shall supply all your need, according to his
riches in glory by Christ Jesus.&mdash;Phil. 4:19.</p>
</div>

<p>These were indeed dark days, the past a record of
sin, the present a nightmare of misery and shame, the
future black with the darkness of despair, with not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the faintest gleam of hope to pierce the gloom. "Poor
fellow," you say, "only one of a multitude." Yes,
only the prototype of one of the thousands who are
traveling the same broad thoroughfare at this moment.</p>

<p>It was at this critical juncture, when reputation
was blasted, hope departed and the future barren of
promises, that a remnant of respect for his home and
the associates of better days awakened the residuum
of pride remaining and brought the determination to
remove his unwelcome presence from the scenes of
former pleasures. He went West, but his hopes were
blasted, and penniless, homeless, wretched, obliged to
accept any kind of menial work in order to eke out
a bare living, he wandered about until an overwhelming
homesickness brought him back to Kentucky.
There was, perhaps, a flickering intention to do better,
to cut loose from the bands that bound him, but good
resolutions were made only to be broken, and the
cords of sin drawn tighter than ever.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?&mdash;Acts 9:6.</p>

<p>Follow thou me.&mdash;John 21:22.</p>
</div>

<p>None but God can realize the extreme bitterness of
that bondage, the depths of that dark and unrelieved
despair. Without light, without hope, without rest,
and worst of all, without Christ? With not one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
friendly hand held out to greet him, with not one
word of encouragement, but rather the cold glance of
scorn, the bitter sneer of contempt, it is not strange
that there stretched out before him apparently nothing
but a drunkard's life, a drunkard's death and an
endless eternity in a drunkard's hell.</p>

<p>Then the fearful temptation of suicide met him;
but God, in his infinite mercy, destined him to pass
through even this fearful ordeal unharmed and spared
him that he might carry the gospel of a Savior's love
to a lost and ruined world. Then a helping hand was
extended. A lifelong friend, meeting him one day,
and overcome with pity, gave him one more chance
to make a man of himself, fitted him out with clothes,
gave him a railroad ticket and money, advising him
to leave Louisville and start life afresh elsewhere. But
the fetters of sin were riveted so strongly that the
well-meant advice of his boyhood friend was unheeded,
and a few hours found him in as fearful a
plight as ever. Then there came into this, the darkest
hour in all his life, the experience of the prodigal son.
A determination came into his life to sever forever
all ties binding him to the life of degradation he was
then living and to take the first step back into the narrow
path of righteousness.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Show me thy ways, O Lord.&mdash;Ps. 25:4.</p>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then that the Rev. Steve P. Holcombe of
Louisville, Ky., took him to the Union Gospel Mission.</p>

<p>At this critical period there came within the radius
of his sphere of existence a noble, devout woman, who
proved to be the one thing needful to round out the
life now worth living. In spite of all remonstrances
on the part of her friends, she was greatly
interested in the welfare of this man and prayed earnestly
that God would make him a strong Christian
man.</p>

<p>Her tireless energies, endless prayers and earnest
teachings were ever present to hold him up and help
him onward in the new life. God placed her in the
sphere of George Herr's experience at a critical stage,
using her as a medium for cementing his faith and determining
his purpose to devote his remaining years
to the work of redeeming unfortunates sunk in the
darkness of sin. Their destinies were welded together
by mutual interest in the work of saving lost men and
the affinity of feeling between them developed into a
bond of love, each seeing within the other those qualities
necessary to happiness in wedded life, and on the
14th of April, 1898, George L. Herr and Miss Lillie M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Joyce, the woman who was such an essential portion
of his existence, were joined in the holy bonds of matrimony
by the Rev. Carter Helm Jones, D.D., pastor
of the Broadway Baptist Church, Louisville, Ky.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>The meek will he teach his way.&mdash;Ps. 25:9.</p>

</div>

<p>George Herr says that the old life, with its bondage
in sin and its darkness of evil, is a thing of the eliminated
past. Finding happiness in his new life, he
has consecrated his time, energy, ability and talents
to continuous devotion to the task of spreading the
gospel among the fallen. Into the gloomiest recesses
of penitentiaries, workhouses and jails, beyond portals
where visitors are excluded, he has carried the
message of Christ's saving grace into the darkness of
despairing men's and women's lives.</p>

<p>God has blessed George L. Herr in many ways, giving
him daily recompense for the days of misery,
shame and degradation, giving him a happy home,
<ins title="Original had glorifield.">glorified</ins> by the presence of a loving, devoted wife
and the precious daughter, and this story is sent forth
with the earnest prayer that God may use it, with its
message of hope and cheer, for the salvation of many
despairing, discouraged ones who are bound by the
awful fetters of sin as he once was.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and
him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.&mdash;John
6:37.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the greatest privileges accorded man is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
be a messenger for Christ. George Herr has tasted
the sweets of liberty in Christ and he loves to tell
those in the terrible bondage of sin that there is an
avenue of escape. In his rescue work he has been able
to take a great number of homeless, friendless and
hopeless men and women by the hand.</p>

<p>Does it pay? The results of George Herr's labors
among the unfortunates are a satisfactory answer to
this question. It pays a hundredfold in the feeling of
duty well done, in the knowledge of many useful lives
saved. It pays in words of gratitude feelingly uttered
by noble men and women, who, formerly sunk in the
quicksands of despair, are now restored to a world
of happiness and peace.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Jesus own words are: "They that be whole need not a
physician, but they that are sick, for I am not come to call
the righteous, but sinners to repentance."&mdash;Matt. 9:12, 13.</p>
</div>

<p>It is our earnest prayer to the Father of all good,
that this story of George Herr's redemption from the
clutches of sin may, through his unfailing love for
all suffering ones, carry its message of hope, its promise
of salvation from eternal despair, into the hearts
of many who are despondent, discouraged, despairing.
May it instill into the hearts of the unfortunate a
desire to come back into the fold of the Father's unending
love, bringing with it the sweet conviction that
no matter how far we have wandered from within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
radius of his love, we are still his children, the erring
ones for whose redemption he gave his Son to
be offered upon the altar of human sacrifice that we,
through the atonement of his innocent blood, should
inherit the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Hold up my goings in thy path, that my footsteps slip
not.&mdash;Ps. 17:6.</p>

<p class="chp">"LOST AND IS FOUND"</p>


<p>Jesus said, "A man had two sons; and the younger
one of them said to his father, 'Father, give me my
share of the inheritance!' so the father divided the
property between them. A few days later the younger
son got together all that he had and went away into
a distant land; and there he squandered his inheritance
by leading a dissolute life. After he had spent
all that he had, there was a severe famine through all
that country, and he began to be in actual want. So
he went and engaged himself to one of the people of
that country, who sent him into his field to tend pigs.
He even longed to satisfy his hunger with the bean
pods on which the pigs were feeding; and no one gave
him anything. But when he came to himself he said,
'How many of my father's hired servants have more
bread than they can eat, while here am I starving to
death; I will get up and go to my father and say to
him, 'Father, I have sinned against Heaven and
against you; I am no longer fit to be called your son;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
make me as one of your hired servants.' And he got
up and went to his father. But while he was still a
long way off, his father saw him and was deeply
moved; he ran and threw his arms around his neck
and kissed him. 'Father,' the son said, 'I sinned
against Heaven and against you; I am no longer fit
to be called your son; make me one of your hired servants.'
But the father turned to his servants and
said, 'Be quick and bring a robe, the very best, and
put it on him; give him a ring for his finger and sandals
for his feet; and bring the fatted calf and kill
it, and let us eat and make merry; for here is my son
who was dead, and is alive again, was lost and is
found."</p>

<p>A case in hand: An acquaintance of mine in Louisville,
a young man of handsome face and fine physique,
with all the advantages wealth, education and
social position could give him, started out at the age
of twenty-one with unfaltering prospects of a prosperous,
useful and happy life, but, like the young man
in our lesson, thought he could manage his own affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
without God; in other words, he refused to give his
heart and life to Jesus Christ, and not having Christ
to protect, shield, restrain, and assist him, in a time
of temptation he was led along little by little, almost
without knowing it, until he was ready to commit any
crime. One day in a house of ill repute he shot and
killed a young man; for this crime he was arrested,
tried and convicted, but the wealth and influence of
his family secured him a pardon. Even this bitter
experience failed to teach him that he had made a
mistake in thinking he could manage his own affairs,
for, after regaining his liberty, he plunged deeper
and deeper into sin, ending in himself being murdered.</p>

<p>As the prodigal in the parable wanted to get as far
from his father's presence as possible, "into a far
country," so the man when he determines to give himself
up to others. He does not want to hear about
God or even think about him. Reader, was not this
so with you? The father did not compel the son to
stay at home; he allowed him to choose what he preferred.
So it is with God; he does not compel us to
obedience. For my part I wish he did. "He wasted
his substance in riotous living;" and so it is with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>

his property, his health, his reputation, his intellect,

<p>There is nothing in this world valuable enough to
recompense such a loss, or balance the misery of a
tormenting conscience. If you violate it for the sake
of a gratification of the body it will remember the injury
many years after. Gen. 42:21; Job 13:26. It
will not only retain the memory of what you did, but
it will accuse you for it. Matt. 27:4. It will not fear
to tell you that plainly, which others dare not whisper.
It will not only accuse, but it will also condemn you
for what you have done. This condemning voice of
conscience is a terrible voice. You may see the horror
of it in Cain, the vigor of it in Judas, the doleful effects
of it in Saphira. It will produce shame, fear, and
despair, if God give not repentance to life. The shame
it works will so confound you, that you will not be
able to look up. Job. 31:14; Psa. 1:5. The fear it
works will make you wish for a hole in the rock to
hide you. Isa. 2:9, 10, 15, 19. And its despair is a
death pang.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate: Some time ago a young man,
son of a nobleman of Germany, came to our home
poorly clad, without money, without friends, realizing
to some extent the depth to which he had fallen,
filled with remorse on account of disgrace he had
brought upon himself and his family, and like the
prodigal in the parable he said, "I will arise and go
to my father." He left our home for his home in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Orleans, La. After his arrival there we received the
following letter:</p>

<p>My Dear Brother Herr: My letter to you from San
Antonio told of the happiness which had come to me
as a result of the reunion of my wife and little ones.
Can you realize how full those days were spent in the
sweet companionship of those who are so dear to me?
I would have wished to have remained with them until
Christmas, but my obligations to business intervened,
and I was compelled to leave in order to attend to
matters here.</p>

<p>My thoughts are with you so much that I often feel
as though I could reach out and grasp your hand;
and so often during the day there goes up a whispered
prayer from my heart that our Father will bless you
in just proportion as you have been a sweet, helpful
blessing to others.</p>

<p>My route includes Louisville, and while I may not
be in there on this trip, it will not be many days before
I will have an opportunity to greet you in person.
May God bless Sister Herr and yourself if only
in recompense for your kindness to me.</p>

<p>Here is a lesson in life that appeals to us and bids
us stop in our mad way. This parable of the prodigal
son shows that we can have our own way if we determine
to do it; father and mother can't keep us from
it, and God by force will not keep us from it; but we
will certainly pay for it, and pay the price of tears
and sorrow, remorse and ruin. This nobleman's son,
by refusing to heed God's warning, was brought to
want. No matter whose son it is, if he determines to
have his own way and give himself up to self-indulgence
and riotous living, he will come to want, shame,
bitterness, and many are the men who tried to master
themselves but failed. Some evil habit had fastened itself
upon him, and realizing himself a slave, tries to
shake it off, but, alas! the will has been paralyzed, and
it does not respond in warding off the fearful habit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Defeat after defeat occurs until the poor fellow, discouraged,
broken-hearted, gives up and goes down to
utter ruin. Man is no match for the devil. How hopeless
would be the outlook for the great army of men
whom we labor with were it not for a Deliverer. "The
cross held his body; the sun hid his face for shame,
and the bowels of the earth were moved in compassion,
when Jesus expired on Calvary's rugged tree,
thus purchasing redemption for every man from the
curse of sin. It is possible through Christ for every
man to be a Christian."</p>

<p>And now here are some of the ways God has taken
to tell you of his love: Psalm 103:13: "Like as a
father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them
that fear him." Isaiah 49:15: "Can a woman forget
her suckling child, that she should not have compassion
on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget,
yet I will not forget thee." Luke 11:13: "If ye
then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
your children, how much more shall your heavenly
Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"
Luke 18:13-14: "And the publican, standing afar
off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven,
but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to me a sinner. I tell you this man went down to his
house justified rather than the other: for every one
that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that
humbleth himself shall be exalted." Luke 15:7:
"I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven
over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety
and nine just persons, which need no repentance."
Luke 15:10: "Likewise I say unto you, there is joy
in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner
that repenteth." Luke 7:36-50: "And one of the
Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.
And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down
to meat. And behold a woman in the city, which was
a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the
Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
and stood at his feet behind him weeping, and
began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them
with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and
anointed them with the ointment.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own

<p>"Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him
saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if
he were a prophet, would have known who and what
manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is
a sinner. And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith,
Master, say on. There was a certain creditor which
had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence,
and the other fifty. And when they had nothing to
pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me, therefore,
which of them will love him most? Simon answered
and said, I suppose that he to whom he forgave
most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly
judged. And he turned to the woman, and said unto
Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine
house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she
hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with
the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but
this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased
to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not
anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with
ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins, which
are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to
whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And
he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>

<p>A father whose son had gone away to California,
and was a gambler in San Francisco, sent him word
by a friend: "Your father loves you still." And it
made him ashamed; it broke his heart; he repented,
returned home and was saved. "God, your heavenly
Father, loves you still." Will you not believe it and
come to him for safety? He will not abuse you for
your sins. He will save you from your sins, and make
you happy.</p>

<p>"And he began to be in want."</p>

<p>That is what sin brings a man to&mdash;want.</p>

<p>And it was this which brought him to his senses&mdash;"he
came to himself" (verse 17).</p>

<p>And when he does come to himself he can think of
only one place where he can hope to find relief, and he
bravely determines to go straight to the very father he
had so shamefully abandoned, and to make a full confession
and throw himself on that father's mercy
with the hope of being taken back as a hired servant.
He is willing to take the humblest and meanest place
if he can only get back to that home he was, a short
time before, so eager to leave. Nor does he offer any
excuse; he calls his sin by the right name and confesses
it without trying to excuse it or justify it.</p>

in the boy's heart and life, and moved with compassion
toward him, he ran and fell on his neck and
kissed him a glad welcome back to his heart and home.

offer to be a hired servant anyhow, and yet the father
says, "No! no! bring forth the best robe and put it

<p>A man married a young widow with a small son.
Her former husband had left her $10,000 in his will.
The man said: "I will take care of you and we will
lay away that $10,000 for your boy." Two other sons
were born to them. The stepson was educated and
taught habits of business. At twenty-one years of
age he asked for the money his father had left. He
was told that instead of being $10,000, it had been invested
for him and was now $50,000. He was asked
to let the money stay in the business and to become
a partner with his stepfather. The young man refused,
took his $50,000, fell into bad habits and lost
it all and came home in rags, a tramp. His stepfather
met him at the train, took him to the barbershop and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
clothier and presented him to his mother at the house
as a gentleman. The nicest room in the house was
assigned him and he was told that it was his permanent
home. He was also told by his stepfather that
he was to be taken into the business firm composed
of the father and the two half-brothers. This was
more than he could stand. He began to weep at his
ingratitude and at the love which had been lavished
upon him. He devoted himself to business, was
devoted to his stepfather, and was as loyal to his interests
as his own sons. This picture, though it seems
overdrawn, is one of real life. The stepfather
had a good disposition naturally, but his magnanimous
treatment of the prodigal was out of his sincere
affection for his wife. There were few ties of
love that bound him to the bad boy, only the love of
his faithful wife. He loved the boy for the sake of
his mother. Our Father loves his children and receives
the prodigals returning to him for their own
sake and the sake of his Son who died for them, and
treats them, in his affection, as though they had never
sinned against him.</p>

<p>He thought it would not be questioned by thinking
persons that we are living in a time of political peril.
He did not mean that revolution was at our door; he
did not mean that we are threatened with a reign of
terror; he did not mean that there was any prospect
of immediate bloodshed.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>I have preached righteousness in the great congregation:
lo, I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest.</p>

<p>I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I
have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have
not concealed thy loving kindness and thy truth from the
great congregation.&mdash;Psalm 40:9, 10.</p>
</div>

<p>Our perils spring from our state&mdash;the state of our
own souls. They are lacking in moral sensibility&mdash;we
are in danger. We are told on every hand our
country was never more prosperous&mdash;that is unquestionably
so. The same might be said of Rome when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
that colossal empire was tottering to its fall. There
were persons then who paid from $200,000 to $400,000
for a single feast. It is recorded of one man that,
after spending several millions of dollars in luxurious
living, he committed suicide because he had only
$400,000 between him and starvation. National bankruptcy
does not stare us in the face. Fortunes grow
up in a generation&mdash;the dollar smiles upon us as a
beneficent sun. Yet our moral condition is such as
to call forth from thinking men serious and earnest
fear. We are as a man living in a luxuriously appointed
house, and yet, on account of invalidism,
unable to appreciate his splendid home and environments.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</p>
</div>

<p>He had called the attention of the congregation last
Sunday night to what was the fundamental source
of our political corruption&mdash;the unnatural separation
of religion and politics. He did not mean separation
of Church and State; that was right and proper; but
he did mean that we need the reign of truth, purity
and righteousness, because of the ills to which attention
was called last Sunday night. His lecture tonight
would be on "The Need of Prophets in a Time of Political
Peril." He did not wish to call attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the peculiarly inspired Bible prophet. So far as he
was concerned he was a man apart, who could not be
our example&mdash;he constituted an order of his own; but
we mortals can to some extent, recognizing our limitations,
reproduce the power of the prophets, and it
is not limited by arbitrary metes and bounds, as God
sends his teachers to every age and every clime. If
there ever was a time when we stood in need of moral
leadership it is now. We want men who come like the
prophets of old, who shall come before us as genuine
leaders to take us out of this wilderness in which we
find ourselves. A fine moral leadership is the exception
rather than the rule. Unless the standard be
lifted up the hosts will not rally. Truth will not win
its way on its own merits. Let the call come from the
lips that speak not lies, but the truth, and there is
that in the humblest of men that will give back an
amen. And when our leaders come we shall recognize
them. We are not likely to mistake the rumble of
cart-wheels for thunder. The leader carries his credentials.
When a community is visited by a prophet
it is known by that community that a prophet has
been among them. You do not mistake genuine fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
You are never deceived by a genuine voice. It has
been true in all ages of the world that wisdom is recognized
by its people. Deep down in the hearts of
the people are the instincts of truth. When we find
men willing to pay the price of leadership we shall
have leaders. It is as true today as it was in the days
of prophecy that such leaders as we have have taught
us to err. We need men with political consciences&mdash;men
who recognize that there are such things as truth,
purity and righteousness in the world.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>What must I do to be saved?&mdash;Acts 16:30.</p>

<p>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
saved.&mdash;Acts 16:31.</p>
</div>

<p>In speaking of moral leadership the all-inclusive
qualification is inspiration. He did not mean the exceptional
inspiration that applies to the Bible prophets.
He meant that inspiration which kindles the
powers we already have into life. When he spoke of
inspiration he meant the enlivening, the stirring up
of the powers we already have as opposed to the shallow
indifference of one who draws about him the
robes of his silken selfishness and says, "Let well
enough alone"&mdash;a man whose inspiration glows and
glows intensely. The inspired man feels the degradation
of his country as a personal infliction. Those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
dishonor her are his own foes, and insults flung in the
face of political liberty are felt by him as an affront
to himself. Our prophets must be men who feel the
woes that they oppose, men who feel the humiliation
before they can strike with the right arm clothed with
power. Indifference to the public weal on the part of
the average political leader is one of the most distressing
features of our political situation. These people
do not seem capable of feeling righteous indignation
in the presence of the moral infamy by which
they are confronted, and hence their words do not
come forth as thunderbolts, but as spent balls. Beware
of the man whose heart has not been pierced by
the woes of his country. The sting is the needed spur
to effort. The sleeping lion is not dangerous; but let
him be wounded and his roar shall ring as the trumpet
of doom in the ears of his enemies. We must seek
our leaders among those who can feel the woes of
humanity&mdash;men of profound feeling&mdash;as those are the
best prophets.</p>

<p>There shall not a hair of your head perish.&mdash;Lu. 21:18.</p>
</div>

<p>Another element required for leadership was the
power of vision. There must be a clear recognition of
evils. The idealist is not a mere dreamer, but acquainted
with the actual wants of the people. In
fact our leaders must see something better. The man
who is working in the slums must keep his eyes fixed
on the stars. There can be no change for the better
until the better is made to shine with the brightness
of a beckoning angel.</p>

</div>

<p>Here is the opportunity and duty of newspapers.
James Russell Lowell says: "What a pulpit the editor
mounts daily, sometimes with a congregation of fifty
thousand within reach of his voice, and never so much
as a nodder, even, among them! and from what a Bible
can he choose his text&mdash;a Bible that needs no translation,
and which no priestcraft can shut and clasp
from the laity&mdash;the open volume of the world, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
which with a pen of sunshine or destroying fire the
inspired Present is even now writing the annals of
God!"</p>

<p>But has the editor no mission other than to tell us
of partisan political measures? To be a simple annalist
who shall bring before us the events of the day,
but who creates no perspective along which we may
tread to better customs, better men and better times?
He never leaves us in doubt&mdash;"Let us do the best we
can, and leave the rest alone." In God's name, is
there not something better? "Let us go up and possess
the land." Standing on the mountain height up
there we shall all see fairer lands below. The inspired
editor not only sees the battle from afar, but also the
coming of the imperial guard of righteousness with
victory. There is that in the heart of every man that
responds to the ideal. No leader has ever succeeded
in having an evil reformed who wanted an ideal. Napoleon,
when he said, "Beyond the Alps lies Italy,"
was appealing to that sentiment&mdash;to something beyond&mdash;to
something in the future. When Cortez drew
an imaginary line before his men, who had become
mutinous, and said "On this side lies danger, death,
duty and glory; on that, safety, shame and infamy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Choose ye whether you will step this side of the line
or remain where you are," he was appealing to something
in their hearts&mdash;put there by the Almighty himself.
Editors should not think it their only mission
to mirror forth things as they occur, but say to their
50,000 readers, "Let us go up and possess the land"
of truth, purity and righteousness. This is not weakness
on their part but evidence of the profoundest
philosophy. Fifty years ago we had senatorial utterances
that would reach across the continent. The
secret power of those utterances was that they were
ideal. In the days when boys spoke pieces in school
we declaimed them, and we feel their influence today.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.</p>

<p>When wilt thou comfort me?&mdash;Ps. 119:82.</p>

<p>Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is
the fulfilling of the law.&mdash;Rom. 13:10.</p>
</div>

<p>Another element of leadership is moral enthusiasm.
The idealist in art is so for the love of art. He enters
into the discussion of art subjects with enthusiasm.
So with the moral enthusiast. Sin is hateful to him,
and he seeks to crush it as he would a viper, and instinctively
and spontaneously his denunciations come
forth. Truth is his pole-star, and he will tell his best
friend, "I will do anything but lie for you." Try
to bribe him, and you will think that the central fires
of the earth have been concentrated into his blistering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
rebuke. Suggest a compromise involving dishonor,
and if you escape a blow you will be fortunate.
Like Luther he says: "Here I stand. I can do no
other. God help me." He would not go with the
crowd to moral destruction. Moral enthusiasm has
been the virtue of all epoch-making men. Men do not
die for fancies; they do not die for offices. They die
for what they believe is right. Give them something
that appeals to their moral nature and they will die
for it. The grand martyrs were men who laid down
their lives for what they believed to be right. There
came to them those lines of James Russell Lowell:</p>

<p>We must have leaders who possess the elements of
leadership for the great task of making the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
better&mdash;who possess the elementary virtues of honesty
and truth. He had indicated some of the elements of
moral leadership that these times demand. He did
not mean to say that the political stage had not such
leaders. Certainly there were a few; but we can make
it possible to have a thousand. When we can see one
we are surprised. In the past, thank God, we have
had such leaders, and in the future we shall have such
leaders again.</p>

<p>It is slumbering in the hearts of men and women all
around us. It needs only some one to sweep the harp
strings. The trouble is with ourselves. How can we
be leaders with sensual and selfish appetites and desires?
Does God no longer speak to man? Burns
there no fire upon the altar? He did not believe God
had exhausted himself. God had not exhausted himself
by casting out a few bright stars from his own
luminous presence. There is power for him to bring
to the front the men we are longing and praying for.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>He shall deliver thee in six troubles; yea in seven there

</div>

<p>In conclusion, he wished to say only these few words&mdash;that
every leader is a man that must bring to us the
message of hope. The prophets through all those
weary years carried the torch of hope and handed it
to their successors. Abraham believed with all his
soul that he should have a posterity as numerous as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the stars. He died leaving only one heir. Moses, the
great law-giver, had a vision that a community of
slaves should be made into a great nation. He went
up into Pisgah and died, leaving them still slaves.
Long ago a prophet looked over the sea at a vision
of a new heaven and a new earth. Two thousand
years have passed away and no new heaven or new
earth has come&mdash;but as sure as truth is stronger than
falsehood it will come&mdash;just so sure we shall one day
see a new heaven and a new earth, where dwelleth no
political corruption, but righteousness. Not in our
time, perhaps, not in our children's time, shall the
thing be; but it will come. Let us pray, then, that we
may answer in the language of the great poet.</p>

<p class="chp">CHRIST THE INTERPRETER<br />
<span style="font-size: .7em;">OF THE PICTURE</span></p>

<p class="center">A Sermon preached by Rev. T. M. Hawes in the Slums</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I have somewhat to say unto thee."&mdash;Luke 7:40.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The scene presented in this narration is worthy of
the painter's brush. We have a beautiful and striking
presentation of the gospel&mdash;not set forth in theological
terms as abstract truth&mdash;but presented in the
form of a concrete example&mdash;a picture with Christ
himself as the interpreter.</p>

<p>And now as we look at this picture with Christ to
explain and interpret it to us, let us see what he will
teach us concerning the gospel.</p>

<p>First, we can learn here for whom the gospel is
not intended.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one
another.&mdash;1 John 4:11.</p>
</div>

<p>Evidently it is not intended for those who find fault
with it. Christ is among a people who seem determined
not to be pleased. He has just wondered to
whom he could liken them, and observing a number of
children at play he likens them to children playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
in the market place. "We have piped unto you and
ye have not danced; we have mourned to you and ye
have not wept." They found fault with John the Baptist
because he was too severe&mdash;they found fault with
Jesus because he was too liberal. And here Simon
is finding fault with him because he is allowing this
sinful woman to wash his feet. Am I saying too
much when I say that there is that same trait in human
nature today, and that it keeps people out of the
kingdom? Yea, more than that, it often keeps those
who are in the kingdom from receiving the blessings
which otherwise might be theirs. There are those on
the outside who remain out because they are constantly
finding fault. There are those on the inside
who are always unhappy for the same reason. If the
preacher hews to the line they say he is a scold&mdash;if he
doesn't they say he is afraid to stand up for what he
believes, and so it goes.</p>

The beloved pastor of the Highland
Presbyterian Church. The &quot;Beloved
John&quot; of the Louisville ministry.</p>
</div>

<p>Let us learn from this picture that the gospel is
not for faultfinders. Our late Mr. Moody says a true
thing when he says that a faultfinder is usually a
lightweight.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner
over me was love.&mdash;S. of S. 2:4.</p>
</div>

<p>Again we can learn from this picture that the gospel
is not intended for those who do not think they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
need it; not intended for self-righteous people. No
one is ever going to appreciate the gospel until he
feels the need of it. The spirit of the Pharisee will
shut us out from the blessings of the gospel whether
we are church members or not. Simon looked down
on the sinful woman and felt that he was far superior
to her. Evidently he felt no need of a Saviour. The
Scribes and Pharisees rejected Christ on the very
grounds that he was the friend of publicans and sinners.
Oh, yes, in the very nature of the case the gospel
cannot reach those who do not feel their need of
some power beyond themselves.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the gospel is not meant for those who
are ashamed of it. There is something very touching
and beautiful in this picture of the woman who was a
sinner coming into this public court to do honor to
Christ. She had true humility. Simon was far from
doing anything of this kind, he was willing to show a
certain sort of respect for Christ, but he would have
been too proud to have ever done such a thing as this.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ashamed of Jesus, sooner far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let evening blush to own a star."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Is it not true that a sense of being ashamed of the
gospel shuts out from its blessings those who entertain
such unworthy feelings?</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.&mdash;Mk.
12:30.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, let us learn from this picture that the gospel
is not meant for those who are not glad to make
a free-will offering of sacrifice as a token of this grateful
love. This woman brought an alabaster box of
ointment.</p>

<p>"My head with oil thou didst not anoint; but this
woman hath anointed my feet with ointment."
Christ did not exact this of her&mdash;it was a free-will offering.
If the gospel does not draw out our gratitude
and liberality, then it has never touched us. It is not
because of our gifts that we are forgiven, but it is
because of our forgiveness that we give. "To whom
little is forgiven, the same loveth little."</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That man may last but never lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who much receives but nothing gives;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom none can love, whom none can thank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creation's blot, creation's blank.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But he who walks from day to day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In generous acts his radiant way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treads the same path his Saviour trod&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The path to glory and to God."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, having learned from this picture for whom
the gospel is not intended, let us learn for whom it is
intended. Ah! how with a few bold and simple
strokes the whole matter is made plain.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&mdash;Mark 11:31.</p>
</div>

<p>First, I notice that it is meant for sinners. "Behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
a woman in the city which was a sinner." Jesus
"a friend of publicans and sinners." That tells the
story. "I came to call not the righteous, but sinners."
Some people find fault with the church because there
are so many sinners in the church. Just as well find
fault with a hospital for having sick people in it. Just
as well find fault with the doctor for visiting invalids.
"Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee; you are
finding fault with me for allowing this sinful woman
to touch me. Let me tell you, Simon, that it is just
for this very purpose that I am come into this world."
"This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation,
that Christ came into the world to save sinners."
He was the great Physician and great physicians are
those who have a specialty. This was Christ's specialty&mdash;to
save sinners. Who is this that forgiveth
sins, also?</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>The end of the commandment is love out of a pure
heart.&mdash;1 Tim. 1:5.</p>
</div>

<p>Secondly, I learn from our Saviour's interpretation
of this picture that the gospel is for the very
greatest of sinners. "Simon, I have somewhat to say
unto thee. There was a certain creditor who had
two debtors," etc. Our Saviour proceeds with an illustration
which shows that this woman was one of
the greatest of sinners. She was ten times worse than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the average sinner, and yet she was more welcome to
the Saviour than this proud, self-righteous Pharisee.
Oh, men and women! if you are in this hall, feeling
that you are unworthy to be here, your very unfitness
makes you fit. Draw nigh to this Saviour from sin
and hear him say, "Thy sins are forgiven; go in
peace." Let no pharisaical Simon frighten you away&mdash;the
Saviour will give him the rebuke which he deserves
and will whisper into your ear words of pardon
and of peace.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods
drown it.&mdash;S. of S. 8:7.</p>
</div>

<p>I learn from this picture which Christ interprets
that the gospel is for penitent sinners. "Simon, I
have somewhat to say unto thee; seest thou this woman?
She hath washed my feet with her tears."
Oh, those were precious tears in the sight of our Saviour.
Every tear-drop was a jewel. The breaking of
the alabaster box of ointment was a sweet incense to
Jesus, but this ten-fold sinner bathing his very feet
with her penitential tears was a sight which made the
angels in heaven rejoice, "for there is more joy in
heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over
ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance."
Simon despised this woman's tears and sat unmoved
at the pathetic scene&mdash;but not so with Jesus. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
could refrain himself no longer, but speaking out before
all the company he said, "Thy sins are forgiven."
Oh, gracious words! How sweet and soft must have
been this music to the ears of this sinful outcast.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They fall as soft as snow on the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And melt in the heart as instantly."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Finally, I learn from this picture which Christ is
interpreting for us that the gospel is for sinners who
commit themselves in implicit faith to Christ. "Simon,
I have somewhat to say unto thee." "Behold
this woman; you have done a great deal of talking&mdash;this
poor woman has not spoken a word&mdash;but behold
how she has thrown herself upon my mercy with unquestioning
confidence! Do you think I will disappoint
such trust as that? She has heard me say, 'Him
that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out' and
has taken me at my word, and I consider it an honor
to turn from thy company to the company of this
sinful woman."</p>

<p>And he said to the woman, "Thy faith hath saved
thee; go in peace."</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Without faith it is impossible to please God.&mdash;Hebrews
11:6.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_FIVE" id="CHAPTER_FIVE"></a>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

<p class="chp">THROWING OUT THE LIFE-LINE</p>

<p class="center">By Rev. H. C. Morrison, D.D.</p>


<p>"Ye are the salt of the earth," "Ye are the light
of the world," "Let your light so shine before men
that they may see your good works, and glorify your
Father which art in heaven."&mdash;Matt. 5:13, 14, 15.</p>

<p>These sayings of Jesus from the sermon on the
mount are quite remarkable. No other teacher ever
used such words to his disciples, "Ye are the light of
the world." Had the Jewish doctor of the law heard
these words of our Lord to his humble sun-tanned,
bare-footed, shaggy-browed fishermen, he would have
been quite disgusted with what to him would have
seemed the consummate egotism of the Nazarene.</p>

<p>The meaning of the words of Christ is very plain.
The disciples, their lives, character, spirit, the power
of the Christ in them must, and would, permeate society
like salt, and purify and save from sin. They
must illuminate the world, so dark with vice, and
show it the way back to God.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with
God.&mdash;Rom. 5:1.</p>
</div>

<p>These words of Jesus to the disciples who sat before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
him that day, are addressed by him to all of his followers
for all time, to all of those who trust him and
gladly obey him (and only such are disciples). He
says, "Ye are the salt of the earth," "Ye are the light
of the world." "Let your light so shine before men,
that they may see your good works, and glorify your
Father which is in heaven."</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>I have somewhat to say unto thee.&mdash;Luke 7:40.</p>
</div>

<p>We must not forget that God's plan is to save the
lost, through the instrumentality of those who were
themselves once lost, but are now saved from sin. If
we would have a great testimony meeting in the city
of the skies, and all of the countless hosts there should
one by one stand up to tell how they were brought
from sin to Jesus, each one of them would point out
some person who had been the chief instrument in
his or her salvation. There is this one characteristic
of all who are truly saved&mdash;they desire the salvation
of all souls. In fact, this is a very good thermometer
with which to get the correct temperature of one's
spiritual life. Does he long for the salvation of the
lost? If so, in the nature of things he must be in a
state of salvation. Is he indifferent to the condition
of the lost? Then he is himself in a lost state. Let
us here impress the important truth that Jesus did
not say to his disciples, "Ye must try and salt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
earth," but said, "Ye are the salt of the earth." He
did not say, "Ye shall kindle a flame that shall illuminate
the world." He said, "Ye are the light of the
world." We are not, as the disciples of Christ, to be
makers of light and salt, but we, by the power of
Christ, must be made into salt and light. It will be
interesting to notice the processes through which one
must pass in order to become salt and light. Let us
go back to the beginning of this sermon of our Lord
and we will hear him saying, "Blessed are the poor
in spirit." First of all to become salt and light one
must be poor in spirit; he must awake to the fact that
he owes a million and has not one cent with which
to pay. From his heart he must say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nothing in my hands I bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Simply to thy cross I cling."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="verses">
<p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right
spirit within me.&mdash;Psalms 51:10</p>
</div>

<p>He must realize in his inmost soul his perilous condition,
and pray from the fullness of a deep conviction
in his heart, "Lord save, or I perish." Not only
must he be poor in spirit, but our Lord says, "Blessed
are they that mourn." God loves to see the falling
tears of sorrow for sin against himself. Those that
truly mourn because of their sins will forsake them.
How blessed for the returning prodigal to come with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
a heart all full of deep contrition. They that mourn
because of their sins shall be comforted. After deep
poverty of spirit and true mourning for sin and the
comforting of the soul by the pardoning mercy of
God. Then meekness will most certainly follow.</p>

<p>Now, the soul comforted, born of God, sitting in
meekness at the feet of Jesus, will "hunger and thirst
after righteousness." A dead man has no appetite or
desire for food, but a living one must eat. The soul
that is born of God will at once begin to hunger for
Godlikeness. The cry of such a soul is not so much
for his blessings as it is for him. The Psalmist says,
"As the hart panteth for the water-brooks, so panteth
my soul for Thee, O God." Jesus says of such,
"They shall be filled"&mdash;filled with purity, love and
peace; filled with the Holy Ghost; filled with all the
fulness of God. All such will be merciful, pure in
heart, peace-makers, and be sure that persecution will
follow. This world that hated and killed our Lord
will not let his followers pass through without persecutions.
Of this we may be sure.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the
land.&mdash;Num. 13:20.</p>
</div>

<p>But with all these graces and past experiences herein
named the persecuted can rejoice and be exceedingly
glad. And of such Jesus says, "Ye are salt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
light." Would the reader be salt and light? Then
pass through the program laid down in the sermon
on the mount. One must be so poor in spirit that he
will be such a mourner, that he will receive such comfort,
that he will become so meek, that in him there
will be such hungering and thirsting after righteousness,
that he will be so filled with righteousness,
that he will become so merciful and pure in heart, that
he will be such a peacemaker, that he will be so persecuted,
that he will so rejoice, that he will be salt and
light, so shining that men will see it and glorify our
Father in heaven. It is folly to be striving to do
something before. By the grace of God and his divine
power we are ourselves made something. Make
the tree good and the fruit will be good. If by the
power of the Holy Ghost we are made right it will be
easy for us to do right. Salt salts, and light shines
without effort. So with true disciples of our Christ.
They cannot exist without proving a blessing to those
with whom they come in contact.</p>

<p class="chp">REFORMATION OF CRIMINALS</p>

<p class="center">[Louisville Times]</p>


<p>In a sermon delivered in the Nashville penitentiary,
the Rev. George L. Herr, formerly chaplain of the jail
here, spoke encouragingly to the inmates, citing cases
of reformation where reform seemed impossible. The
Rev. Mr. Herr took occasion to pay a high tribute to
Jailer John R. Pflanz, of Louisville. He said in part:</p>

<p>Repent ye therefore and be converted.&mdash;Acts 3:19.</p>

<p>When I address you upon this subject I speak from
the standpoint of one who knows by bitter experience.
I know that sin can rob man of fortune, and all the
luxuries of life. I know that it can rob him of the
love of all who ever loved him; I know that it can
drag him down from a position of prominence, and
make him a habitue of the dives; I know that it will
cause him to place a rope around his neck and hang
himself to a rafter in his own barn; I know that sin
will lead him to pause at the railing of a bridge, his
mind set upon the awful deed of self-destruction; I
know that it will tempt him to take a razor in hand
and draw it across his throat. I know that sin will
reduce him from a position of influence, a welcome visitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
to the homes of the elite, to a degraded drunkard,
homeless upon the streets of his native city, robed in
a short linen duster and a straw hat in the dead of
a bitter winter's night.</p>

looked him in the face when he confessed, but
he had faith in God, and he led him through all the

<p class="sect">A Jail "Miracle."</p>

<p>I shall speak now of a miracle of the prison cell.
Several years ago the great D. L. Moody was holding
meetings in St. Louis, Mo. The Globe Democrat announced
that it was going to publish Mr. Moody's sermons.
He made up his mind that he would weave in
plenty of Scripture for the newspaper to carry into
places that he could never enter. One night he
preached on the Philippian jailer, and next morning
the paper came out with a sensational headline, "How
the Jailer of Philippi Was Caught." A copy of the
paper was carried into the city jail, and fell into the
hands of a notorious prisoner. This man was one of
the worst characters known to the St. Louis police.
He was about forty years old at that time, and had
spent about twenty years in prison, and was then
awaiting trial on a serious charge. As he glanced
over the morning paper, the headline caught his eyes.
Thinking that it was some jail news he began to read
it.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
faith,&mdash;1 John 5:4.</p>
</div>

<p>God used it to convict him, and a sense of his responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
before God rushed upon him. There in
his cell at midnight he prayed for the first time in
his life. On the following Sunday he talked with
Christian friends who held service in the jail, and was
led into the light of the gospel. From that night he
was a changed man. The sheriff thought he was playing
the "pious dodge," and had no confidence in his
professed conversion. But when he came to trial the
case against him was not pressed, and he escaped
through some technicality.</p>

<p>For some months after his release Burke tried to
find work, but no one would take him, knowing his
past history. He thought perhaps it was because of
his ugly face. He went to New York and was taken in
by a member of the police force, who knew him, and
who told him he would shoot him dead if he abused
his confidence.</p>

<p>Being unsuccessful in New York, he returned to St.
Louis. One day this man who had realized what the
"enemy" had done for his life received a message
from the sheriff that he was wanted at the courthouse.
He obeyed with a heavy heart.</p>

sheriff, but I haven't lost my religion."</p>

<p>"Burke," said the sheriff, "I have had you shadowed
ever since you left jail. I suspected your religion
was a fraud, but I am convinced that you are
sincere, as you have lived an honest life, and I have
sent for you to offer you a deputyship under me. You

<p class="sect">Tribute to Burke's Honesty.</p>

<p>This was in 1880. When Mr. Moody was preaching
in Chicago in 1890, Burke, who had not been off duty
for the ten years, came to see him. During all that
time there had been many changes in the administration
of the sheriff's office, and they had changed every
deputy but him. Finally they appointed the ex-convict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
treasurer of the sheriff's office. Mr. Moody
preached in St. Louis again in 1895. A short time before
his visit an evangelist was called away in the middle
of the revival meetings. The committee wanted
Burke to come and preach in his absence, but the
sheriff said he had just levied on a jeweler's store and
had not had time to take an inventory, and Burke
was the man he could trust to put in charge of it.</p>

<p>He was held in such confidence by the police that
they did a most unusual thing; they gave him a photograph
they had of him in the Rogue's Gallery. He
had his photograph taken again in 1887, and in sending
a copy of this along with the original Rogue's
Gallery photograph, to Mr. T. S. McPheeters of St.
Louis, to show the change in his features, Burke wrote
a note:</p>

<p>"Notice the difference in the inclosed pictures. See
what our holy religion can do for the chief of sinners."
On the back of the Rogue's Gallery photograph
he wrote:</p>

<p>"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth
the needy out of the dunghill, that he may set him
with the princes, even with the princes of his people."

<p class="chp_a">Visit to Nashville, Tenn., Prison</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilburn, of Nashville, writes of Mr. Herr's
visit to the Nashville prison as follows: It was my
great pleasure as we reached the door to find Brother
Herr, of Louisville, Ky., awaiting admission. It was
raining, cold and dreary without, but he carried sunshine
on the inside of the prison to the sad prisoners.
The large chapel was filled with eager listeners and
he received a most hearty welcome and all were delighted
to see their true friend Brother Herr. It was
indeed a sight to make angels rejoice to see how
eagerly they drank in every word. I believe many
darkened lives from whom all hope had fled were
encouraged once more to look up. Hundreds of faces
grew brighter as he told with burning words how God
had saved convicts steeped in many crimes, causing
judges in different states to set them free; when they
were told that Jesus had blotted out their past and
made new men of them. At the close of his sermon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Brother Herr asked all who would pray when alone
in their cells that Christ would save them too from
the power of sin, and transform their lives as He had
others, to hold up their hands; as quick as a flash
hundreds of hands white and colored were raised
above their heads and, oh, how our hearts rejoiced as
we saw the hope in so many lives. We are looking to
God who giveth the increase to bless the seed sown
in those sad hearts, and earnestly pray that when the
great harvest day comes many of these men may testify
that the sunshine of God's great love entered
their hearts on that dark dreary day in December.</p>

<p>Dear Brother Herr:</p>

<p>When you handed me your little book "Lost and
is Found" I had no idea what a treasure you were
placing in my hands. Undisturbed in my cell tonight
I read it through and wished for more. I read it the
second and third time, and your sermon so impressed
me I read it the fourth time,</p>

heard many sermons on the "Prodigal Son," but none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
that in such a convincing way drives home the awfulness
of sin as does your description of this, to me,
the dearest of Christ's parables.</p>

<p>What I like about you most in all your talks with
the prisoners is this, you never show a man how bad
he is or how low he has fallen without showing him
how good he can become or how high he may rise,
and it's always in a way that appeals to the heart of
the man.</p>

<p>God grant that while under your influence and in
the knowledge of "your way back to Christ" I and
many of the lost ones within the prison may be able
to throw off the shackles of sin and return to our
Father's love.</p>

<p>Your noble work among fallen men will never be
known in its entirety in this world, but in that to
come God will surely number you among those who
have brought unto him a great harvest of precious
souls.</p>

<p>May God bless you and your dear Christian wife
in uplifting the fallen ones, is the earnest prayer of

<p class="chp_a">The Work of a Prison Evangelist</p>

<p class="center">By Geo. Wm. Wood</p>

<p class="center">[From the Courier-Journal Nov. 17, 1912]</p>

<p>To the right-thinking man there can be but one
answer to the question, does the work of an evangelist
pay? As well might we ask does the beautiful
life of a true Christian pay? As well might we ask
the farmer, as he carefully tills the soil and sows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
seed and labors to cultivate the grain, does it pay?
What answer would you expect from the shrewd business
man of today should you ask him the question
does it pay, when he labors and advises to keep down
expenses. He would promptly answer in the affirmative.
Let us bring the question closer home. Ask the
prisoner behind the bars, does it pay to respect the
law? He will answer yes. So for the question does
the work of an evangelist pay behind prison bars there
can be but one answer&mdash;yes.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly.&mdash;1
Ch. 19:13.</p>
</div>

<p>Sitting tonight in our lonesome cell, bounded on
three sides by blank and barren walls of steel, through
our two-by-six door, constructed of massive bars of
iron, there comes to us the conversation of our fellow
prisoners, as with head pressed close against the bars
to catch the other fellow's words, we listen to the talk
of the men "committed for crime"&mdash;men strong and
healthy, who should be engaged in some honest labor,
but, instead, are "doing time" for a broken law. We
had no idea of the meaning of the words "doing time"
until being placed behind these bars, we took up the
daily life of a prisoner, and with nothing but "time"
to look to, began the task of trying to be contented.
We believe from our own past ideas of prison life that
very few of the outside world have any conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of what the prisoner's life really is, or what it means
to be sentenced to a term in prison.</p>

</div>


<p class="sect">Judge Does Not Understand.</p>

<p>The judge who pronounces sentence upon the evil
and unfortunate knows as little of the meaning of the
terms he uses in meting out punishment as the mail
clerk knows of the contents of the letters he handles
at his daily task. "Danger" conveys but little meaning
to the mind of the engineer who has never had
a wreck. By the standard of freedom, a day in prison
is a year, and it is only those who mingle daily in our
midst can talk to the "man behind the bars," who
can have a fair idea of what the prisoner suffers daily
in "doing time." The world that lies beneath the
bars is a strange world to the average citizen, the citizen
blessed with average good fortune. Prison life
is a queer and twisted one, and a law to itself.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
Christ&mdash;Ph. 1:27.</p>
</div>

<p>But to return to the prisoners' conversation, of
which we spoke. Vile&mdash;yes, dear reader, this word
does not convey to you the full measure within the
writer's mind. At times it seems that some have sunk
so low that all conception of honor and truth have
passed entirely away. No reverence whatever for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
words as "mother, home or heaven" left within their
minds, for they are rendered entirely void of good
thoughts or honest ideas, having been so long filled
with the one thought&mdash;crime.</p>


<p class="sect">Prison Record for Life.</p>

<p>Men who started on their "career of crime" as
mere boys, with years of youth spent in reform schools
only to be developed into men of crime, have prison
records to follow them through life. Many of these
men feel that they have lost all hope of any but the
criminal's life. Many of them have been forsaken by
family and friends. So to the man or woman who
is at all interested in the uplift of his fellow man,
can you think of any field where the labor of an evangelist
is more needed than it is among the men we
have attempted to describe to you?</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong&mdash;1
Corinthians 16:13.</p>
</div>

<p>Then there is the paramount reason why the evangelist
is needed. Men who would not on the outside
of prison give one minute of their time to listen to
the evangelist as he tried to persuade them to take a
new lease on life let him engage their attention by
the hour as he shows them the error of their way and
points them to a better life. There are those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
listen to his talk and turn away in scorn to ridicule
his teaching. But as the days follow on, and the newness
of the prison life begins to wear away, they listen
with more respect to the "man of God."</p>

Chicago, Ill.</p>
</div>

<p>We have seen men behind the bars who never before
bent their knee in prayer. After listening to the
evangelist's story of God and his love, they go to
their cells, and upon bended knees, beg for mercy and
help.</p>

<p>Brother George L. Herr has taken the word of the
Master into many of the prisons of the United States,
but the jails and penitentiaries of his native State of
Kentucky have claimed much of his time and attention.
We must confess when first coming in contact
with him, our feeling against him was bitter, we did
not want his friendship nor his help, only because we
were angered by his denouncing our pet sins. But
as days lengthened into weeks, and weeks into months,
the truth of his kindly spoken words came home to us.
Life was stripped of all its so-called pleasure, with
nothing but its disgrace and shame left to mock us,
having sold out to the "demon of crime."</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Why art thou cast down? Hope thou in God.&mdash;Psalm

<p>Then we began to feel the need of his wise counsel
and to realize the good of having him among us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
He was always ready and willing to help each and
every man, not only with advice and counsel, but in
so many substantial ways, trying to lighten the prisoner's
burden and make his life better and brighter.</p>

<p>He has also devoted part of his time to writing
books. Those we call to mind are "Light in Dark
Places," "You Are My Prisoners," "The Life Line,"
"Man's Worst Enemy," "Nothing Better," "The
Missionary," "The Bethel," "Lost and is Found,"
"A Glorious Rescue," and his new book, "The Nation
Behind Prison Bars," soon to be brought out.
Hundreds of thousands of these books have been sent
broadcast over the world, and through them great
good has been accomplished. Well might he be called
the "Prisoner's Friend," for his desire to aid each
and every man gives to him this well-earned title.</p>

<p>Full of generosity, kind far beyond the ordinary
meaning of the word, always ready to forgive the
aggressor and to forget the offense, he wins his way
into the hearts of wicked and violent men in a manner
that makes them his lasting friends, and turns
their words of condemnation into words of praise.</p>

<p>We fancy, as we write tonight, while, for the moment,
the stillness of death has fallen upon the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>

righteous indignation, through the prison corridors,
calling some man to account for his vile language or
his taking in vain the name of God.</p>

<p>If you were to ask a prisoner to what church Brother
Herr belongs he would no doubt plead ignorance,
as no faith nor creed is known in his work among the
men. He makes no distinction between chapel-goers
and non-attendants, and will do a favor for the worst
man in prison as readily as for the leader of the chapel
quartet; but ask the same prisoner, "Who is it that
speaks to judge and the warden about the sick mother
who longs to see her imprisoned son before she dies?
Ask him.</p>

<p>Who pleads with the Governor?</p>

<p>Who tries to soften the heart of the prosecutor?</p>

<p>Who provides shoes and clothing for the poor prisoners?</p>

<p>What unpaid messenger runs the errands of the
prisoners?</p>

<p>Who reconciles the erring son in prison with his
mother and father?</p>

<p>He will answer, "Brother Herr."</p>

<p>Now, the average prisoner may be deficient in the
matter of mental balance, but he is not an imbecile.
He is a better judge of character and a keener observer
than the more honest and commonplace fellow
man. By the same keen powers of observation that
belong to the criminal type, he notes that Brother
Herr differs from many other prison evangelists, for
he helps without asking questions. He has no theory
or dogma to exploit, and he labors for the uplift of
humanity.</p>


<p class="sect">Tribute to Jailer.</p>

<p>Much that we have written of this great work was
made possible by Jailer John R. Pflanz, who for the
past twelve years has been at the head of the Jefferson
County jail. He is constantly laboring to better
the conditions of the prisoners and give to the people
an honest administration and progressive system of
prison management.</p>

<p>To him Louisville and Jefferson County owe a great
deal for the good work accomplished among the criminals.
Brother Herr says:</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Deal courageously, and the Lord shall be with the good.&mdash;2
Ch. 19:11.</p>
</div>

<p>"If such men as John R. Pflanz, of Louisville; John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
L. Whittman, of Chicago; Co. E. E. Mudd, of Frankfort,
and Col. Dan Bartley, of Cincinnati, were placed
in office for life the criminal world would greatly decrease
every year, instead of being on the increase."</p>

<p>We have never heard of any prisoner complain of
unjust treatment by him, but on the other hand, many
are the unfortunate men who leave this prison to take
their places in business again, because of assistance
given them by Mr. Pflanz.</p>

<p>His regular rounds through the entire prison are
always hailed with delight by the prisoners, as he is
ever ready to hear their complaints and remedy any
existing evil. He listens to all the appeals for help
by the prisoners and leaves no unfulfilled promises.</p>

<p>His personal inspection of the "cell-house" and inquiries
about the health and general welfare of all the
prisoners, make him always a welcome visitor among
the men.</p>

<p>Mr. Pflanz's desire to change the criminal into a
respected citizen and the assistance he gives to bring
about this result proves his thorough understanding,
brought about by years of study and personal contact,
of how to deal with this class of our citizenship.</p>

<p class="mag">[Louisville Herald]</p>

<p>Henry E. Youtsey, sentenced to life imprisonment
in the penitentiary for his complicity in the murder of
Governor Goebel, and at the present time the most distinguished
prisoner confined behind the cold, gray
walls of the State prison at Frankfort, has at last
"got religion."</p>

<p>The man who has succeeded in reaching the heart
of this man whose name emblazened the front pages
of newspapers from coast to coast almost ten years
ago, is the Louisville prison evangelist, the Rev.
George L. Herr. The medium he employed was a little
pamphlet containing the simple story of the reformation
of one Dad O'Brien, an erstwhile scalawag
who was finally converted to a new life.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed
our transgressions from us.&mdash;Psalm 103:11.</p>
</div>

<p>Rev. Herr, who has carried the gospel into the cells
of many a poor, crime-stained wretch, not only here in
Louisville, but in every prison-house in the country
and has accomplished a great amount of good among
the outcasts of society, recently received a letter
dated October 16, 1909, which reads:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am delighted to learn that you visited all the
cells today and left in each one the tract, 'How Dad
O'Brien Became Converted.' I have read it, and it
is simply an additional evidence of a truth that has
long been known to sincere evangelists like yourself
to the effect that no matter how hardened and steeped
in sin a poor fellow may be, the love of God can win
him and Jesus can save him, and he can start life
anew, singing praises to his Redeemer, and winning
the lives of his old companions for the Master. I believe
that the happiness of O'Brien's latter years
more than made up for all he suffered&mdash;for he enjoyed
a portion of the most glorious life that could be lived
here below. When you get into heaven, as you surely
will, Dad O'Brien will be the brightest star in your
crown. Yours most sincerely,</p>

clearly see in the main corridor in the building, down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>

a snowy cloth, and then in charge of the Hon. John R.

jailer in all the world.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Come out from among them and be ye separate, saith

<p>But that table and its delicious burden: Turkey
after turkey, four of which weighed more than twenty-five
pounds each, with all the trimmings, including
dressing, cranberry sauce, etc. There were oysters
fried, and oyster soup, with crackers and celery. And
what an array of cakes! As I remember, there were
chocolate and caramel, layer and black ones, in short,
almost every kind of cakes and pies known to the culinary
art. Then there were bushels of oranges, apples
and mixed nuts, and for a time all of us forgot
about stone walls and iron bars, for what a merry
time we did have discussing that repast!</p>

<p>"It gives me pleasure to add my testimonial to the

George Herr as prison evangelist," says the Clifton
Baptist church pastor. "Three times I have heard
him tell the simple gospel story of Jesus and his love.

<p>"Mr. Herr has had a wonderful, but costly experience,
which fits him peculiarly for the special work
among prisoners. From a wealthy man, living in a
mansion, sin blindly led him to poverty, robbed him
of his money, property and friends; but God came
into his life and now he rejoices that he is a child of

him."</p>


<p class="chp_a">Sermon in State Prison</p>

<p class="mag">Rev. Jos. Severance, Chaplain, says in the Courier-Journal:</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable meetings in the annals
of the prison was held in the chapel of the penitentiary
at Frankfort, Ky., Sunday morning. George L.
Herr, of Louisville, a friend of Chaplain Severance,
was present and spoke from the fourth and twelfth
verses of the 103rd Psalm. The sermon was a strong
appeal to the men for gratitude to God for the rich
provision for the redemption of the race and urging
them to accept the mercy of God and allow him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
remove their sins from them "as far as the East is
from the West." The chapel was crowded to the
doors, and during the sermon that lasted for an hoar
no one moved and none went out.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>My feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh
slipped.&mdash;Psalm 73:2.</p>
</div>

<p>At the close of the sermon the gospel invitation
was given and a total of forty-two men came forward,
some to confess faith in Christ (of these there were
thirty-seven) and others to renew their vows. Hundreds
asked for prayer in their behalf. Among those
who came were some of the hardest men in the prison
and more noted for insubordination and disobedience
than for piety and morality.</p>

<p>But the Chaplain believes that the per cent. of those
who remain true is as great among prisoners as among
those outside.</p>

<p>Bro. Herr knows the prison work as few men do.
He is a man of large sympathy, and having had an
experience of fifteen years as an evangelist knows
how to reach the hearts of the men. He has the entire
confidence of both prisoners and officials and is
always given a most hearty welcome by all.</p>

<p>The baptism of the thirty-seven men who made confession
Sunday will be attended to next Sunday morning.
Mr. Herr will return to the baptism.</p>

<p>The Rev. George L. Herr preached yesterday at the
Frankfort penitentiary for the Rev. Joseph Severance,
who was filling another engagement. Several hundred
men and women asked for prayer, and fourteen
confessed Christ and were baptized in the prison pool

<p>The prisoners in the Frankfort penitentiary were
again blessed by a visit from Bro. Geo. L. Herr, the

Bro. Jos. Severance, the chaplain, was absent from
the city and therefore could not fill his appointment.</p>

<p>Bro. Herr read that most beautiful 37th Psalm,
which is replete with comfort for those who are in dire
distress and in need of consolation, placing special
emphasis on those passages which teach patience and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
faith in "The God who is mighty to save and strong
to deliver."</p>

<p>Bro. Herr never fails to extend the invitation of
the gospel; in fact, that is his strong point, and is
recognized by him to be the most important part of
his work as an evangelist. His labor was rewarded,
as he won eight souls for our Lord and Saviour.</p>

<p>The following representatives, members of the present
General Assembly, were present at the morning
services: W. H. Jones, Princeton, Ky.; John T.
Shanklin, Johnson, Ky.; W. A. B. Davis, Mt. Vernon,
Ky.; Albert Butler. These gentlemen have been coming
regularly, which proves that they are interested
in our welfare, and also devoted to the church services.
We are always proud of their presence, and invite all
their colleagues.</p>

<p>At the afternoon Christian Endeavor service, Bro.
Herr made an extemporaneous address in which he
revealed the secret of his wonderful success as a soul-winner,
which the writer would call unlimited charity,
and inexhaustible brotherly love; the love that always
instantly forgives, and as quickly extends a hand to
help a fallen brother rise.</p>

<p>The eulogy he paid his wife, whom he acknowledged
to be the inspiration to his life, was most beautiful.
At this service he won five more souls for his hire,
making thirteen for the day.</p>

<p class="chp">JIM O'BRIEN: MODERN MIRACLE</p>

<p class="byline">By George L. Herr</p>


<p>Several years ago I met in the Jefferson County jail,
Louisville, Ky., "Dad O'Brien," one of the worst
criminals I have ever known. Fifty odd years of age,
forty years a thief and twenty-five years behind the
bars. The sentence in the jail was a light one&mdash;one
year and a half&mdash;for having received stolen property,
but he had stolen from one to tens of thousands. He
was son of a prominent physician of Cincinnati,
for twenty years professor of anatomy in the Ohio
Medical College. He began by stealing from his
mother's purse and then, when punished by his father,
would steal his father's instruments and sell them for
revenge. His father, being a very stern man, drove
"Billy" from home, and the night came on with no
place to go.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word,
and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life,
and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from
death unto life.&mdash;John 5:24.</p>
</div>

<p>He led a low, degraded life, and was finally arrested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and sentenced to serve ten years in the Columbus
penitentiary. When he was about to serve his first
sentence&mdash;which seemed to him a lifetime&mdash;a young
lady, an old schoolmate and who had been visiting him
in jail, proposed marriage to him, so she could have
the right to visit him in Columbus and provide him
with the comforts of life, as far as possible. She was
a girl of means, and he was stunned by the proposal.
For, he said, he had not thought of such a thing as
a wife. But he told her to come back the next day
and he would let her know. She did, and he accepted
and they were married on the eve of his leaving for
the penitentiary. He only served part of the sentence,
and when released went to the home of the girl
and began life in a new way, only to fall in the old
rut in a short time. He kept up his criminal life for
years.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>"But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all
of them snared in holes, are for a prey, and none delivereth:
for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. Who among
you will give ear to this? Who will harken and hear for
the time to come?"&mdash;Isaiah 42:22.</p>
</div>

<p>The good wife died, and after her death he became
one of the most notorious bank robbers in this country.
While in the county jail at Louisville, Ky., Dad's
friends were standing nobly by him. He had plenty
of money sewed in his clothes to meet his every need.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
I tried hard to reach him, but he was determined not
to have anything to do with a "Sky Pilot," as he
called me. The first time I spoke to him he almost
spit in my face, but that never daunted me. I was
more determined to win him. I saw he was a diamond
in the rough. He had a bright mind, a man filled
with history.</p>

<p>While in prison in Louisville, Ky., he became interested,
and determined to quit the old life. After
this determination he immediately wrote his intentions
to his old pals on the outside, and told them not
to send him any more money, for he was done with
that life. They told him he was a fool and had gone
crazy, and everything else they could think of.</p>

<p>But he was that kind, when he made up his mind
to do a thing he did it.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our
refuge.&mdash;Psalm 46:7.</p>
</div>

<p>Then it was my opportunity for the practical side
of Christianity, for I believe in that side. His clean
laundry must be supplied, extra food that his old
companions had been having sent in from the restaurants
must now be brought by the missionary from
home. Many are the baskets of food I have carried
from my cottage home to this man. But the time was
coming when he was to be released and nowhere to go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and that was the thing that seemed to trouble him
most.</p>

<p>I said: "Never mind, 'Dad,' when you get out of
this prison-house come to my home, I'll take care of
you and help you to a good life." Well, one night,
at about 8 o'clock he knocked on the door. How glad
wife and I were to see him! He often said, "How
warm the fire looks and how home-like to see you all
sitting around." We gave him a good warm supper,
a good bed, the best room in the house, but that was
not all he needed. The next day was the beginning of
the real battle. The detectives were hounding him.
But to keep them from rearresting him we sent him
across the river until we could plead with the officers
to give this man another chance. We believe had it
not been for the great interest taken by John R.
Pflanz, the jailer, at this time for this man, that he
would have died in a cell in some far Eastern prison.
He said, "What's the use? Let me alone; there is
only one thing for me and that is to go back to the
old life." We said, "'D,' we'll see you through."</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>I know not how to go.&mdash;1 Kings 3:7.</p>
</div>

<p>All this time we were trying to find employment for
him. All this time he was growing impatient and
would say: "A great big husky fellow like me laying
around on a little man like Brother Herr." He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
weighed about 190 pounds, but we would encourage
him by saying, "Well, Dad, you know God's people
have all things in common, and he knows you are
here, and when he sends to us he sends it for you as
well."</p>

<p>One day when we were talking, he said: "Brother
Herr, those old charges in Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburg,
Cincinnati and New York are hanging over me
and I must face them."</p>

<p>We said, "Well, Dad, if you have made up your
mind you would rather live for God behind the bars
than to live for the devil on the outside or the inside,
God will see you through. Go and face these charges,
and if you mean business, God will take care of you."</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>I will guide thee.&mdash;Ps. 32:8.</p>
</div>

<p>He went first to St. Louis and told the judge on the
bench that he had quit the old life forever. They
looked at him, and even those who were his bitter enemies,
said, "Give him another chance; go and be a
man and we will help you." He came back to our
home from St. Louis, stayed a few weeks and started
for the other charges, encouraged by the last trip.
He went to Chicago first, and they told him the same
thing there; then he went to Cincinnati, then to Pittsburg,
and they said, "Dad, if you mean business you
shall have a chance." Then he went to New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
where he and three other men had robbed a bank of
$175,000. When he went in to see the New York people
they did not know him. He had been living a
Christian life for several months. Salvation changes
the looks of a man, and takes away the hard lines and
softens the eye; and when he told them who he was,
they said: "My God! where did you come from and
what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>He told these gentlemen what had taken place in
his life, and of his determination for the future. Said
one wealthy man, "Well, Dad, go on your way and
may God be with you and help you."</p>

<div class="verses">

<p>He went on a hunt for the old friend "Hinky
Dink" down in the first ward. "Hinky Dink" saw
him, paid for a week's lodging at the Mills Hotel, and
gave him money for meals each day. Finally one day
"Hinky Dink" and Dad, standing in the front of his
(Hinky Dink's) saloon, called "the workingmen's
bar," where they line up by the fifties at a time, looking
in, "Hinky Dink" said, "Dad, you are worth $18
a week to me behind that bar." Dad said, "Me?
Not me for $1,800 a week. I am a Christian, I have
quit all that, never to return again." "Hinky Dink"
said: "Well, what do you want, anyhow?" Dad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
said: "I want to go to Cincinnati to the Holiness camp
meeting." "Hinky Dink" said, "Where?" (this
being all Greek to him), as it was not in his line, he
knew.</p>

<p>"Dad" repeated what he had said, and "Hinky
Dink" said: "Come right over here and I'll buy you
a ticket." He took him over to the railroad office,
and bought him a limited ticket to Cincinnati. Dad
said, when telling us, "He thought he was shipping
me in the quickest way possible, but it was the Lord
taking care of 'Old Dad,' and sending him in first-class
style."</p>

<p>Again he came back to our home, stayed several
weeks, then we got him $20 worth of religious books
to travel around to the camp meetings to sell, and to
tell his experience, for the people were eager to hear
this wonderful experience of God's transforming
power, wherever he went. We started him off, and he
soon felt his call to preach the gospel. He was ordained
in Indianapolis in 1905, and preached up and
down the land, winning lost men and women for Jesus.
His life was a miracle of what God's grace can do.
He married a fine Christian woman, who was a great
help to him in his work.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1908 he died a triumphant death,
leaving a glorious testimony behind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>


<p class="chp_a">Jim O'Brien Passes Away</p>

<p>The Courier-Journal republishes herewith from the
Indianapolis Herald an editorial by the Rev. George
E. Bueler, pastor of the Methodist Episcopal church,
Indianapolis, Ind.:</p>

<p>"The Rev. William H. Frazier, alias Jim O'Brien,"
died at Indianapolis on Monday, October 30, 1908.</p>

<p>"At an early age Frazier began associating with
bad boys on the streets of Cincinnati and of course
was soon drawn into sin. At the age of 14 he began
stealing, at first on a small scale, and increasing with
the years until he became one of the most daring and
successful bank robbers known in America. He was
arrested and in prison many times, but when at
liberty he drifted back into crime again. For forty
years he was a criminal; of that time twenty-three
years and six months was spent behind prison bars.
Although he stole hundreds of thousands of dollars
he was released from prison the last time in Louisville
with only $2.40 left. What wages for forty years
in the service of Satan! While incarcerated in the
Jefferson County jail, at Louisville, Ky., Missionary
George L. Herr found this wretched man and through
many months of persistent effort found a way to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
heart. At first the missionary was met with curses
and abuses, but love conquered, and the result was
Jim's conversion, a miracle indeed, for, from that
time in January, 1903, "Dad," as he was known,
lived a godly life and retrieved for the past by telling
everywhere he went his life story, showing forth the
glory of God's redeeming grace. No one knew better
than Bro. Frazier what it meant for a man to be released
from prison and again face the world. With
the disgrace and odium upon him it is well nigh impossible
for him to find honest employment, for no
one knowing him to be an exconvict wants him in
their employ, the temptation to return to the old life
is strong. With this in view he began making homes
for such men in large cities. While Bro. Frazier was
working and starting a home in Cincinnati he was
made prison chaplain for the entire city. During the
past summer he and his wife came to Indianapolis.
While here his physical condition gave way; he knew
his end was near. To those who waited on him in his
last hours he constantly affirmed his faith in God and
passed peacefully away. The funeral was conducted
by the Revs. Parker, Stevens and Bueler, with special
singing by Mr. Maxwell, Mrs. Bueler and Mrs. Nelson.
All who want a more complete account of this wonderful
life should read his book, "From Crime to
Christ."</p>

interest of the men "behind the bars." The Rev.
Mr. Herr also had a delightful visit with his son, of

<p>The Courier-Journal republishes herewith from the
Ohio Penitentiary News an editorial by the Rev. D. J.
Starr, D.D., chaplain at the Columbus, O., prison:</p>

<p>"The Rev. George L. Herr, whose address delivered
in our chapel last Sunday morning was charmingly
refreshing, is a man whose vicissitudes of life lead
through a labyrinth that would require a half century
of years to make its journey at an ordinary pace. But
George L. Herr is not the man to do anything in an
ordinary way. The itinerary of his life shows few
curves&mdash;mostly acute angles. He was born in an old
Kentucky family of the city of Louisville. His ancestral
stock was golden, and his infancy was fed with
a golden spoon on sugar and cream. When he was
three months old his Christian mother went to be
with God. When he was 18 years old his father,
Richard S. Herr, a capitalist of Louisville, died and
left George the heir of a large patrimony.</p>

<p>"The orphan was genial, sportive, rich and without
domestic restraint. Men seized the opportunity to
take advantage of his tendencies and youth to filch
from him his wealth. He yielded, and threw on the
neck of appetite the slackened rein and became woefully
dissipated. He mounted the toboggan and went
down the slide, landing in a few years in the gulch of
destitution and near the precipice of suicide.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Teach me thy way, O Lord.&mdash;Ps. 86:11.</p>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here in destitution and despair on the day after
Christmas, 1893, the Rev. S. P. Holcombe, of Louisville,
found the prodigal and led him into the Union
Gospel Mission, where he sought and came to know
God as a personal Saviour. What a change! New
bottles for the new wine of the Spirit! As language
cannot picture the degradation of the prodigal, neither
can it picture the exaltation of the son restored to
the Father. George was as whole-hearted in his new
life as in his old. He had beauty for ashes and a
spirit of praise instead of heaviness. After nearly
five years of the new life George L. Herr, in the city
of his fall and his recovery, was married by the Rev.
Dr. Carter H. Jones, pastor of Broadway Baptist
Church, to Miss Lillie M. Joyce. George says
that if a man ever outmarried himself he's the
man. He says God gave him this priceless treasure
of a Christian wife in answer to prayer. Those who
know Mrs. Herr speak of her as sweet-spirited, noble,
devout, gifted in song and speech and one in spirit
with her husband in the work of saving those who
are out of the way. Their home is filled with the
aroma of grace and their united lives are spent in
doing good. How wonderfully God fulfills His ancient
promise to present-day prodigals: 'As ye were
a curse, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Bible-school at 8 o'clock through the doorway
of life beyond, which Christ left open that men might
both look in and go in, the 300 students saw some of
the things that "God hath prepared for them that love
Him." The germinal thoughts of John 14:1-14 are
that heaven is a place&mdash;a roomy place, a prepared
place, a place where the Lord abides and where he
will have his prepared people to abide with him.
And that in this doctrine is the cure for human sorrow.
"Let not your heart be troubled * * believe."</p>

<p>At the 9 o'clock meeting the quotation of Scripture
verses appeared like apples of gold in pictures of silver.
Rev. George L. Herr was introduced and the
hearts of hearers beat warm under their jackets as
the speaker sang and talked to them of Jesus and His
love. It was good to be there.</p>

<p>The Great Congregation gathered at 10 o'clock and
was welcomed with the stirring notes of the band men.
The many voices lifted in the chant, "Gloria Patri,"
showed how grand the effect would be if all would
join in the song. Why not all?</p>

<p>"A Rose in Heaven," and "Life's Lullaby," were
admirably sung by Miss Lucile Bethel with her sister
Miss Bethel as accompanist at the piano. The anthem,
"Ashamed of Jesus? Never, No Never," was sung by
the choir as the author of the song might have wished
to hear it rendered.</p>

<p>That old story of the prodigal son was the subject
on which Rev. George L. Herr of Louisville, Ky.,
preached to the inmates of the penitentiary Sunday
morning in the chapel, but it was the twentieth century
prodigal who formed his main theme.</p>

<p>Mr. Herr is known all over the country as the prison
missionary. He has all the vivacity and warmth of
the Southerner. He illuminated the old parable with
the story of his descent from the position of a son of
a wealthy Kentucky home, possessing a large estate,
to the destitution of a linen duster for a December
coat, and from a seat in a Pullman to riding the bumpers
of a cattle train. That was his condition sixteen
years ago. The men enjoyed the object lesson and
cheered the moral heroism evinced in the life-story
of the missionary.</p>

and was heartily received by all who heard
him. He is doing a noble work in the prisons all over
our country. We spent a pleasant afternoon together,
visiting the sick in the prison hospital, and we believe
God blessed the seed sown. The Evangel wishes him
and his dear wife God speed in their self-sacrificing
efforts for the lost. We take great pleasure in calling

<p class="date">Louisville, Ky., March 12, 1901.</p>

<p>Mr. Geo. L. Herr,</p>

<p>Dear Sir: I have recently been asked by several
persons on different occasions if I thought much good
could come out of the rescue work done at the county
jail. In every instance I would answer "yes." A
great deal of good is done through the Christian
workers, and especially by you, who not only give
your time and attention to this work, preaching the
gospel on the Sabbath, but on every day of your life
doing everything in your power to lighten the burden
of the unfortunates confined in the jail.</p>

<p>I have known prisoners of all classes look forward
to your arrival each day with gladness, knowing that
if you did not have something to distribute among
them you would give them a cheery good morning.</p>

<p>As a rule you always have something to give them,
which gladden their hearts and make them think better
of our harsh world, wherein they are buffeted
around like so many things to be despised.</p>

<p>I have never known you to come to this jail that
you were not interested in some poor fellow's case,
and often have I known you to call on either the
Judge of the Police or Criminal Court to intercede
for some person confined in our jail. I have noticed
that whenever you come you are asked by more than
one of our prisoners to go on some mission, either to
a father, mother, or some other relative. Distance
and barriers have no terror for you, as was evidenced
in your recent trip fifteen hundred miles for one of
our prisoners to see his parents.</p>

<p>In every case you have with promptness attended
to requests, always with a cheerfulness that is surprising
to those who cannot understand and will not
learn. These are the things that lift up the hearts of
the poor unfortunate prisoner and make him feel that
there is something worth living for.</p>

Your frequent visits to us are always appreciated
both by the chaplain and the prisoners, and your

the furtherance of the work of grace in our midst.
I can truly say there are eyes that "mark your coming

deliverance by the grace of God, how by a
life of sin he squandered a fortune, how God found
him a bond slave of appetite and other sins and delivered
him, the romantic way in which his God-given
companion entered his life, and how they are being
used perhaps as no other persons today in helping
those "behind the bars." This story will warn the
reckless, encourage the "cast out" and put a desire

<p class="date">Louisville, Ky., July 24th, 1902.</p>

<p>Rev. George L. Herr,</p>

<p>My Dear Brother Herr: It is with much regret
I have heard of your determination to leave us. You
and your good wife have now been engaged, for about
four years, in the noble work of saving souls in the
Jefferson County jail, and to the success of your efforts
I can truly bear testimony.</p>

<p>I must confess that at first I had little hope of much
good being accomplished, but your constant devotion
at all hours, night and day, has worked wonders, and
I am satisfied that many who came steeped in sin and
in their own minds hopelessly lost, have left the prison
at peace with God, and with a determination in the
future to lead a better life.</p>

<p>Wherever you go, may God be with you, is the wish
of all who know you, and especially that of your

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>

<p>I take pleasure in commending Mr. Geo. Herr to
the esteem and confidence of the public. I have been
placed where I have known intimately his work as
Prison Evangelist in Jefferson County Jail&mdash;a place
incomparable in my opinion for testing the character
and power of a Christian worker. I can say he has
made a superb record and been able by divine assistance
to rescue many from the life of crime. He has
taken an enlarged field of work because he has been
convinced it was the call of the Highest, and I have
every confidence in his increased usefulness. I cheerfully
commend him and his work. His book is true

<p>The Rev. J. A. Holton, Chaplain Eddyville Penitentiary,
commends Rev. Herr's work:</p>

<p>The Rev. George L. Herr, the well-known Louisville
prison evangelist, conducted the chapel services at
the Eddyville State penitentiary, Eddyville, Ky., on
Sunday, February 16. Mr. Herr's address to the
prisoners made a very decided impression upon the
men. In a letter to Louisville, J. A. Holton, Chaplain
of the penitentiary, writes of Mr. Herr's visit to
Eddyville as follows:</p>

<p>"Brother Herr is a fluent and earnest talker and
speaks from personal experience and observation with
telling effect, timely words that tend to the betterment
of his hearers. No one who is acquainted with his
personal history and present effort in the cause of
prison reform could doubt his sincerity. It is not a
surprise, therefore, that from every sphere of his
labor along the line of evangelistic work in the prisons
of the land come unsolicited testimonials commending
him and his work."&mdash;The Louisville Times.</p>

<div class="verses">

<p class="mag">[The Louisville Herald]</p>


<p>For fifteen years Mr. Herr has carried the great
truths to the outcasts, giving warning of the danger,
and thousands have repented and have been rescued
from lives of sin and shame and are now blessings to
the community. Hundreds of thousands of tracts,
sermons, books, papers, etc., have been distributed,
the results of which can never be known.</p>

<p>"One of the saddest features of this work is that
we are constantly beset by the sad-faced, grief-stricken,
broken-hearted mothers and wives who have
been so unfortunate as to lose their loved ones in sin,"
declared Rev. Herr. "They come to us and plead for
us to help find the wanderer.</p>

<p>"The pitiful stories of disgrace, shame and disappointment
that come from the broken hearts who are
victims are beyond expression and almost enough to
melt the heart of stone into a river of tears, and to
stir us who hear them and see the helplessness of unfortunate
ones.</p>

<p>"There never was a place where the gospel was
needed more and where it would do more good, than in
the prison houses of our beautiful land."</p>

<p class="center">"I am done with a life of thieving."&mdash;E. B.</p>


<p>Another of the days in jail that will long be remembered
by some of the poor unfortunates who have been
making this place their residence for some time. The
missionary who makes prison work the work of his
life preached to the men today, the service being in
the place of the regular Saturday services, because
the convicted men were to go to the penitentiary Saturday
morning, and Brother Herr intended to go to
Cincinnati, Ohio, this evening. So the good brother
gave the men some good, wholesome advice.</p>

<p>And in opening the services, that always appropriate
song of "Let a little sunshine in" was sung,
and the good God knows that if any one in this world
needs "sunshine" that person is the one who is behind
prison bars.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</p>
</div>

<p>I have seen some curious things in my wandering
life, and some very curious and saddening sights are
to be seen in jail. To see men right in the prime of
their manhood going to a living tomb, to actually
bury themselves for years, is a sight not easily forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Oh, the misery, the shame, and the degradation
of it all. It is no wonder that some of the unfortunates
weep. The sight of so much misery seen at one
time is enough to melt the heart of the most hardened
criminal. As I watched the men put up their hands
in reply to the question of "How many of you men
want to lead a better life?" I could not blame any
one of the prisoners for putting up their hands in a
resolve to lead a clean life.</p>

<p>My sympathy is with the unfortunate. I have been
placed in positions just like these men are placed in,
but never again! Oh, I hope that when I finish this
term of imprisonment that I may find some means of
employment that will bring me in enough money to
keep body and soul together. From this time forward
I am done with stealing. I hope that my right hand
may lose its cunning and my eyes grow dimmer, so
dim that I cannot see anything to steal. I am done,
done with a life of thieving. I don't know how I am
going to exist, but I am not going to steal any more.
By the help of the good Lord I intend to reform.</p>

<p>Austin, Tex., Dec. 2.&mdash;(Special.)&mdash;Jake McKinney,
who was serving a life term in the State penitentiary
at Rusk for the murder of Robert Walker in Jones
county seven years ago, has just received his pardon
from Gov. O. B. Colquitt on the strength of an appeal
for liberty in the form of a poem that he wrote and
sent to the Governor. This poetic application was
turned over to Mrs. Colquitt by the Governor and it
was upon her recommendation that McKinney was
given his liberty. McKinney was twenty-four years
old at the time of his conviction. During the last four
years of his imprisonment he was editor of the prison
newspaper, the Alcalde Chronicle. He attended night
school while in the penitentiary. His poems and articles
in the little newspaper that he published attracted
much favorable attention. His pardon application

<p>The habitual user of profane and indecent language
was mercilessly flayed by Bishop Charles E. Woodcock,
of the Episcopal Church, at the Board of Trade
noon-day Lenten service yesterday, where in the
course of his sermon the Bishop pronounced the profane
man to be intellectually deficient, corrupt, morally
and wholly unchristian.</p>

<p>"No gentleman will use profane language; it is only
the low-born and vulgar-minded person who will do
so," declared the Bishop. "No man who believes in
God and in God's commandments can be profane."</p>

<p>Among other things stated by the Bishop of a like
nature are the following:</p>

<p>"The profane man in God's eyes is on the same
plane as the murderer or thief. He violates the ten
commandments."</p>

<p>"Swearing, aside from being sinful, is low, vicious,
vulgar and most reprehensible."</p>

<p>"The profane man is in many cases and in most
cases the man who will steal, slander, lie and violate
the every commandment of God."</p>

<p>In beginning his sermon the Bishop spoke of the
work of the noon-day Lenten services. He said in
part:</p>

<p>"By coming before you men and preaching we rectors
hope to arouse, encourage and bring out all the
good in you. We aim to plant high ideals in your
hearts and make you better men. It is one of the greatest
pleasures I have&mdash;preaching these noon-day Lenten
sermons. It is my earnest and sincere wish to do
good and to carry a message to you.</p>

<p>"Christ will lighten your eyes: He will enable you
to see things worth being and worth doing. The worth
while in life is what makes life worth living. He will
give you a view of yourself. He will make you see
yourselves as others see you. He will not only do this,
but he will set a guard before your lips.</p>

<div class="verses">
<p>The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
my God, my strength, in whom I trust.&mdash;Ps. 18:2.</p>
</div>

<p>"No man ever regretted keeping from impure
speech. Habitual obscene story telling grows like
other vicious habits. It is a manly thing to possess
clean lips. Does not the Bible say, 'Blessed are the
pure in heart?' Well, no man can be pure in heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and impure in speech. Would you tell some of the
stories you tell your fellow men to your wives and
daughters? No, I do not think you would. Then say
to yourself, 'Thou God hearest me.'</p>

<p>"Keep your lips from profanity. The profane man
in God's eyes is on the same plane as is the murderer
and thief. He, like both, violates the ten commandments.
Swearing, aside from being sinful, is low,
vicious and vulgar and most reprehensible. The man
who will curse and swear is in most cases the man
who will steal, slander, lie and violate every commandment
of God.</p>

<p>"I have been in hotels and in public places where
I have heard men swear as though they thought it a
virtue. These men I find are seldom well thought
of in a community. The man who is well thought of
will not swear.</p>

<p>"The man who will swear will say mean things
about his friend; he will gossip and slander. If you
keep your lips clean you will never besmirch a man's
or woman's character. You will never speak until
you know it is time; you will be restrained from telling
vicious things, because you will reason whether
or not it is right, and whether or not it ought to be
told."</p>

<p>Never did Mr. Herr have a more interested audience
than greeted him in the Cincinnati work house yesterday
when he preached for an hour in the prison
chapel. The men and women wept as his words
brought conviction to their hearts. Were it not for
this wonderful gospel, said the speaker, he himself
might be as the worst prisoner among them. At the
close of the sermon he asked all those who desired to
lead better lives to bow their heads in prayer, and
almost every man and woman in the chapel fell on
their knees, while the eloquent evangelist lifted his
voice in their behalf. The closest attention was accorded
him during the whole time and when the prisoners
were dismissed and passed out of the chapel
amid a stillness that was very impressive, Mr. Herr
spoke to a great number personally shaking them by
the hand and urging them to repent and believe the
gospel.</p>

today in a startling address made in Minneapolis to
the Interstate Sheriffs' Association by Charles W.
Peters, chief deputy sheriff of Cook County.</p>

<p>The unexpected suggestion that the man who will
not reform ought to be slain by legal means aroused
much discussion in Chicago among ministers, lawyers
and laymen.</p>

<p>Leniency for first offenders, parole for the worthy,
an adult probation law, were advocated by Mr. Peters,
who then insisted that in cases where life has proved
a failure, where efforts of reformation have been ineffectual
and the criminal is a body sore on the social
system, that extermination should be resorted to.</p>


<p class="sect">Only One True Reform.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he created intense surprise by his
assertion that in twenty years' experience in handling
criminals he could recall only one case of true reformation

<p>In his address to the Association, Mr. Peters recommended
various ways of dealing with crime and its
perpetrators, and then for the irredeemably incorrigible
made this recommendation:</p>

<p>"And then if they fail to embrace the many opportunities
offered them, and after everything has
been done that is possible for mankind to do, they repeatedly
persist in returning to their old ways, I
think in such a case life has proven a failure, and
they become a menace and a burden to our social welfare
and should be exterminated.</p>


<p class="sect">Like Weeds in a Garden.</p>

<p>"They are like weeds in a garden and unless removed
will supersede the useful plants.</p>

<p>"Many students of criminology have suggested life
imprisonment, but in my opinion that has proven a
failure. By that method the menace is removed, but
the burden remains.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to acknowledge that in the twenty odd
years of my experience in the handling of criminals
I can recall only one case of true reformation on the
part of habitual criminals, and that man is employed
in a bridge works, where it would be impossible for
him to carry anything off."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>


<p class="sect">"Judge Not," Says Pastor.</p>

<p>Among the ministers who commented on the startling
theory of extermination were:</p>

<p>Rev. P. J. O'Callaghan, pastor of St. Mary's
Church and the priest who saved Herman Billik
from the gallows&mdash;What is man that he should put
himself in judgment on a fellow and say that the culprit
is beyond reformation and redemption and slay
him? Man is too fallible to condemn another as an
habitual criminal and exterminate him. No one knows
when a man has passed beyond the pale of reform. As
a matter of fact, many and many a criminal branded
as 'habitual' has been saved to a useful life. I most
heartily disagree with any suggestion to execute any
man on the theory that he is irredeemable.</p>


<p class="sect">Hope While There Is Life.</p>

<p>Rabbi Tobias Scharfarber&mdash;In the first place I am
opposed to capital punishment, but, in any event, I
should not agree with this suggestion of Mr. Peters.
It is much like Osler's plan to kill off men of
sixty or more years of age, or Ingersoll's suggestion
that when a man believed himself to be a failure and
useless to the world he should go and shoot his brains
out. While a man lives there is hope for him, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
one has either power or right to say that he will always
be a menace to society.</p>

<p class="mag">[Courier-Journal]</p>


<p>"Do you know who I am?" once said a person in
the jail here to the Rev. George L. Herr, prison evangelist.
"I will tell you. I am the worst and most
treacherous man in this prison." Then the Rev. Mr.
Herr says he told him the story of his fearful crimes.
"I have been in prison North, South, East and West,
I have been in the dismal, solitary cell for one year,
have been put in large tanks of ice water, have been
punished over and over again, but it has always made
me more of a demon. Would you like to know what
the officer who last locked me up said about me?"</p>

<p>"'Take him and lock him up like a brute beast, for
that is what he is.'"</p>

<p>Then he turned and said: "Do you think there is
any hope for me?" "I was at once on ground where
I could speak without hesitation," said Mr. Herr,
"and I told him simply that if he was through with an
evil life, if he was tired of wrong-doing and was determined
to do right, there was a love that could forgive
him, and a power that could help and keep him in the
future. When at last we knelt together there I prayed
that God, who could bring light into our darkness,
might dispel the thick clouds that had shut in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
soul from hope, and bring to him the revelation that
would change his life. There were tears in our eyes
as we parted, and, taking my hand in his he said: "I
will try, Brother Herr."</p>

<p>"He did try, and, more than that he conquered. At
first it was a stern battle of an awakened will and conscience
fighting against desperate odds. The feeling
that friends were watching and waiting anxiously for
good reports proved an undoubted incentive. It was
not long before he sought and found Christ as his
Saviour, and he became an earnest Christian, and to-day
is an ordained Methodist minister, at the head of
a great rescue work in an Eastern city, and also chaplain
of a model penal institution."</p>

<h2><a name="Success_of_Reformed_Criminals" id="Success_of_Reformed_Criminals"></a>Success of Reformed Criminals</h2>

<p class="sub">After Blotting Out the Past</p>


<p>"Once a Thief, Always a Thief," has been disproved
in thousands of cases according to Mr. William
A. Pinkerton.</p>

<p>"Do criminals ever reform, really turn over a new
leaf and become good citizens?"</p>

<p>I fired the question at random, little dreaming what
a wealth of interesting and convincing anecdote it
would evoke. I expected the time honored cynical
reply, something to the effect of "Once a thief, always
a thief," But I was disappointed&mdash;agreeably
disappointed. For my answer was a quick, emphatic,
earnest "Yes."</p>

<p>And the man who said "Yes" was William A. Pinkerton,
and he knows.</p>

<p>Probably no living man knows more intimate details
about the individual members of the underworld,
those who are active criminals to-day, as well as the
notorious crooks of the past, than the head of the
Pinkerton Detective Agency. And every crook will
tell you, what every honest man who knows Mr. Pinkerton
will tell you, that when he says "Yes" there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
is no possibility that the correct answer should be
"No."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">WILLIAM A. PINKERTON<br />
Head of the Pinkerton Detective Agency
New York</p>
</div>

<p>"I know what the average man thinks&mdash;that a real
crook never turns straight. But it isn't so. Thousands
of crooks&mdash;and I don't mean one-time offenders,
but men in the class we call hardened criminals&mdash;have
become honest men to my knowledge. It is not
true, as some recent writer said, that as many crooks
turn honest as there are honest men turn crooked,
but I believe that one of the reasons is that so few men
are willing to lend a helping hand. I don't mean
that every crook is ready to reform if he is encouraged,
but I do mean that society makes it hard for
any man who has once been a criminal to lead an
honest life.</p>

<p>"And I'll tell you another thing," continued Mr.
Pinkerton: "I'm prouder of the fact that I have
helped a few criminals to become honest men than of
all the work I have done in putting criminals behind
the bars. I'm proud of the fact that every crook
knows that Pinkerton will deal squarely with him if
he will deal squarely with Pinkerton&mdash;that I believe
it is as important to keep faith with a bank thief as
with a bank president.</p>

<p>"I know a score of business men in Chicago&mdash;not
saloonkeepers, but reputable merchants&mdash;who have
criminal records. These men have done time and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
paid their debt to society for their crimes. I cannot
tell you their names, for it would be unfair to them
and to their wives and families, many of whom have
no suspicion that there is anything wrong in the pasts
of their husbands and fathers. Besides, when society
discovers that a man is a former criminal it is not content
to cancel the debt no matter how much imprisonment
at hard labor the former crook may have
given in expiation of his sin.</p>

<p>"I know men in trusted positions in New York who
were convicts. In many cases only the man himself
and his employer know the secret and sometimes the
employer does not know it. I know men scattered all
over the West&mdash;business men, professional men, many
of them wealthy and prominent citizens&mdash;who have
seen the inside of Joliet, Moyomensing, Sing Sing or
Leavenworth. They have sons and daughters who
never have suspected and never will suspect the truth.</p>

<p>"These are good men&mdash;as good men as any living.
They have turned away from their old ways, in many
cases have changed their names, and who shall say
they are not as much to be respected as the honest
man who never was tempted, never was forced into
crime? I'll tell you about some of them.</p>

<p>"When I was a boy in Chicago there were two
brothers, neighbors, about the age of myself and my
younger brother, and we were friends. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
civil war broke out I went into the army secret service
at the age of fifteen, and the older of these two
boys, John, enlisted in an Illinois regiment. Jerry,
the younger, was not old enough, but a little later,
when the government began offering a bounty for
soldiers, he became a bounty jumper. He would enlist,
get the bounty money, then desert and enlist over
again under another name. He was with a band of
young fellows who were engaged in that way of getting
easy money, and who found it so easy that they
turned to other kinds of crime.</p>

<p>"When the war was over John came back to Chicago
and settled down as a rather plodding sort of
a mechanic. He tried to get Jerry to straighten out,
but the younger brother was too far along the road
to prison.</p>

<p>"In those days the Northwestern Railroad used
wood for fuel, and the wood agent of the road was
Amos Snell&mdash;the same Snell who was later murdered
by 'Willie Tascott.' He lived in a suburb of Chicago,
and one night Jerry and his crowd went out
there and 'stuck' up the whole family&mdash;robbed them
of everything they had. John was along with them,
lying in the bottom of the hack. The police got a clew
through the hack-driver and rounded up the whole
band. All of them, including John, were sentenced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
five years each except Jerry. When he came into the
hands of the police a citizen who had been held up
on the street some time before identified him as the
hold-up man, and on the strength of that the Judge
gave him fifteen years. It was an unjust sentence,
for Jerry had not committed the hold-up&mdash;that was
found out later.</p>

<p>"Well, John's old Colonel and some other army
men and my father got together and got a pardon for
John, who had merely gone along with the crowd and
had taken no part in the robbery. He went back to
work at his trade of brass finisher, but Jerry stayed
in Joliet, rebelling against those long unjust years of
his sentence.</p>

<p>Jerry was put to work in the engine room of the
prison and soon displayed great aptitude for machinery.
He served out his term with time off for good
behavior and finally got out. I met him in Chicago.
He was despondent. He felt that he had no chance
to be anything but a crook, but he knew the terrible
chances a once convicted man runs if he returns to
crime. I told him the best thing for him to do was
to go to New York, and I sent him on to my brother
Robert, who had also known him as a boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>


<p class="sect">Reform of Jerry.</p>

<p>"Now, here's a part of this story that will interest
you. Robert had a friend who was chief engineer of
a building in Ann street. He told this friend about
Jerry, and the engineer said he'd take a chance on
him. He put Jerry to work stoking the boiler at a
dollar and a half a day. After a year or so there was
a vacancy and Jerry became assistant engineer. A
little while later the chief engineer resigned and Jerry
after awhile, the ex-crook, became chief engineer. He
left there after awhile to take charge of a big plant
on Long Island, and he sent for his brother John and
gave him a job.</p>

<p>"A few years later the two brothers called on me
in Chicago. They had saved about $6,000 between
them and were on their way to a new town in the
West to start a manufacturing business of their own.
Each had married a girl who knew nothing of their
prison record and had children. They prospered exceedingly.
John died several years ago, but only a
few months ago, when my brother Robert died, an old
man, whom nobody but myself recognized, came from
the West for the funeral and shed tears at the grave.
It was Jerry. He is still living, and is the leading
citizen of his town and worth at least half a million
dollars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Criminals who reform? There are thousands of
them. I remember a little Liverpool Irishman who
was a pickpocket around New York. He was known
as 'Jimmy the Nibbler'. The police picked him up in
Tennessee, where he lifted somebody's pocketbook,
and he was sent to Nashville for seven years. In the
prison they put him to work in the hospital. Then
the cholera epidemic broke out. "Jim" helped the
doctors and nurses, and when the doctors got sick
he nursed them and the warden and his family and
helped save a good many lives. After the epidemic
was over the warden and the Prison Board were so
grateful they got "Jim" a pardon and made up a
purse of $350 for him. With the money in his pocket
he came right to Chicago to see me. I began to
lecture him on the futility of going back to the life he
had led before.</p>

<p>"'I've cut that all out,' he said. 'I'm not going to
be a gun any more. I've been studying medicine
down there in Nashville. The doctors have been telling
me things and giving me medical books to read
and now I want to get into one of these colleges where
I can get a diploma quick.'</p>

<p>"There were a number of diploma factories, as the
lower class of medical colleges were called, running
in Chicago then, and Jim found he had money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
enough to go through one of them&mdash;in the front door
and out the back. But he got his diploma and license
to practise and started for one of the new towns in the
West. I looked him up a while ago. He comes pretty
near being the most prominent citizen in the town.
He is a director in a national bank and the leading
physician, and has officiated at the births of half the
present population. Moreover, he is an enthusiastic
church member. But how long do you think it would
take for the whole town to turn against him if they
should ever learn out there that he is 'Jimmy the Nibbler'?</p>

<p>"Crooks that turn straight? Your next door neighbor,
your family physician, even your clergyman, may
be one of them. The world is full of them. There
was one man, a professional thief, a fellow who had
done time in half a dozen State prisons and penitentiaries,
whom I used to labor with earnestly every
time he got out, but he apparently never tried to reform.
He was always doing time, it seemed.</p>

<p>"I lost track of him for several years. Then two
years ago, when the National Association of Chiefs
of Police was in session in Buffalo, I found a note in
my box in my hotel signed by this man's name. He
said he was going to call at seven o'clock. There was
a banquet on for that evening, and hundreds of police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
officials from every part of the United States were
there. I wondered if he knew what sort of a lion's
den he was walking into. Sure enough he came into
the hotel and spoke to me.</p>

<p>"'Don't you know that you are surrounded by
policemen, some of whom are sure to spot you?' I
asked him.</p>

<p>"'You're the only man in the world who knows
me,' he said, 'My name now is So and So'&mdash;giving me
another name&mdash;'and I'm a respected and prosperous
man. I just wanted to let you know before you
found it out for yourself, for I knew you'd be on the
square with me.' And I was. So far as I knew he
was not wanted for anything, and what good would
have come of exposing him?</p>

<p>"Thieves who resist the temptation to steal? Hundreds
of them. There's one right here, only a few
blocks from where we are talking. He's the watchman
in a big silk warehouse&mdash;and if there's anything
your professional thief likes to steal, short of money
or diamonds, it's silk, for you can get so much value
into so small a package. This man was a professional
safe blower, and did several big jobs. When he got
out of prison I helped him to get the job he has now.
His employer knows his record. I told it to him on
the man's own request. When work stops for the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
this man is left alone in charge of hundreds of thousands
of dollars worth of valuable silks. He isn't
bonded, for he couldn't get a bondsman if he wanted
to. He has held the job seven years now, and not a
cent's worth has been taken from the warehouse in
that time.</p>

<p>"You may say that he does not dare to steal&mdash;that
he knows a single false move on his part will bring
instant punishment. But I say he has no desire to
steal&mdash;that he has reformed. And thousands of other
criminals would reform if society would give them
half a chance.</p>


<p class="sect">Baffling Hotel Robberies.</p>

<p>"Several years ago there was a series of hotel robberies
in New York that baffled the police. The thief
always worked with keys, opening doors and then unlocking
baggage left in rooms, and he always got away
with the goods. At last one night the word came to
headquarters that a man had been caught in one of
the big hotels who was suspected of being the author
of all the robberies. I was visiting Chief Devery at
the time and he asked me to go with him to the West
Thirtieth street station to look the man over.</p>

<p>"The man arrested was a well dressed, respectable
looking little man, with a white beard&mdash;the last man
who would be taken for a thief if seen in a hotel corridor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
His face was vaguely familiar to me, but I
had some difficulty in placing him. Finally it struck
me. I had seen him nearly thirty years before on the
occasion of a big prize fight in New Orleans, when he
had been arrested for the same trick. It came over me
like a flash and I told him I knew him.</p>

<p>"'What's the use of making trouble?' he asked.
'These fools don't know anything about me unless
you put them wise.'</p>

<p>"I told Chief Devery what I remembered about the
man, who protested violently that he had never been
in New Orleans in his life. Then another thought
struck me.</p>

<p>"'You've been in New Orleans more than once,' I
said. 'The last time was about six months ago, when
you got Denman Thompson's diamonds in the St.
Charles Hotel.' I remembered the report of that case,
but it was a chance shot on my part, for no one had
seen the thief. The old fellow denied this vigorously.</p>

<p>"He was wearing a new derby hat. I don't know
what impulse prompted me, but I took the hat off
his head and looked inside. It bore the mark of a
New Orleans hatter.</p>

<p>"The Chief and I left the station and had just
turned into Sixth avenue when I remembered the old
fellow's name. We went back to the station house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and I confronted him again. I told him his name. He
denied that it was his.</p>

<p>"'What's the use of making trouble, Mr. Pinkerton?'
he pleaded. His inadvertent use of my name,
which had not been mentioned there, gave him away.</p>

<p>"'I don't know what kind of a case the police here
have on you,' I told him, 'but we are retained by the
Jewelers' Protective Association, and if you get after
any jewelry drummers I'll make it hot for you.' And
as a precaution I got his photograph from the New
York police. They didn't have much of a case on him
and he got off.</p>

<p>"Not long after a jewelry drummer was robbed in
a Chicago hotel of about three thousand dollars'
worth of diamonds which he had carelessly left in his
grip instead of putting them in the safe. The same
day a friend of mine who was stopping in another
hotel lost his new overcoat and told me about it. I
thought of the old man in the first job, and found a
chambermaid and bellboy who had seen him on the
floor, but didn't connect him with the second because
he had never stolen anything but very valuable articles,
so far as I knew. My friend had to leave for
New York that night, and some time in the evening
I got a telegram from him which had been filed in
Fort Wayne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Positive man who got my coat is in same sleeper,
ticketed to New York,' it read. I wired my friend at
a point further along the line to get off at Pittsburg
and hold a white handkerchief in his hand so he
could be identified and be prepared to point out the
thief. Then I got in touch with Pittsburg by wire,
and sure enough back came a wire after a while to
the effect that they had got the man, whom my friend
identified, and found on him besides the overcoat
about $3,000 worth of diamonds. I asked for a description
and the one they wired fitted that of the
man I had seen in New York. I referred Pittsburg
to the man's photograph, which had been published
that week in a police periodical, and they were sure
they had the same man. And so it proved. He was
brought back to Chicago and convicted of the jewelry
theft. He served a short sentence, and when he
got out he came to me.</p>

<p>"Mind you, this was an old man, who had been a
thief all his life&mdash;I had known him as a thief more
than thirty years before. It is criminals of that kind
that are commonly regarded as the most difficult to
reform, but even hardened and lifelong offenders like
this man will go straight if they get the right kind
of encouragement. I found this old man apparently
anxious to be honest, but he had never had a chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
after his first slip as a young man. I determined to
do what I could for him and I got him a job in New
York. He is more than seventy years old now, but
he is still holding that job, and he hasn't made a false
step since he got out of prison the last time.</p>

<p>"Do criminals ever reform? I think I have told
you enough to prove that they do&mdash;and I could tell
you of hundreds of other instances if you needed any
further proof."</p>

<p>Dear Brother Herr:</p>

<p>Your book, "Light in Dark Places," received. I
do so much appreciate your kindness in remembering

<h2><a name="Lost_and_Is_Found" id="Lost_and_Is_Found"></a>"Lost and Is Found"</h2>

<p class="sub">Noted Prison Worker issues an Interesting Book</p>

<p class="mag">(Louisville Herald)</p>


<p>An interesting booklet containing the sermon "Lost
and Is Found," the newest publication of the Rev.
George L. Herr, the noted prison evangelist whose
home is in this city, has just been issued from the
press. The sermon is one of the strongest yet issued
by the Rev. Herr, and is written in the characteristic
vein which marks all those issued by the prison
worker.</p>

<p>Rev. Herr holds a unique position in the evangelistic
field. He is considered the greatest evangelist
among prisoners in the United States. Scarcely a
big prison in the country has not been visited by him
in his work, and the number of men in stripes who
have been reformed by the indefatigable prison worker
reaches into thousands.</p>

<p>Some of the most notable redemptions of so-called
"hardened criminals" known to evangelistic work
have been accomplished by the Rev. Herr. All of the
booklets by him have been extensively read and
quoted, and it is probable none will attract more interest
than that which has just been issued by him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="Christmas_at_Frankfort_Prison" id="Christmas_at_Frankfort_Prison"></a>Christmas at Frankfort Prison</h2>


<p>The prisoners had what was unanimously voted the
best Christmas dinner in many years. There were
1100 lbs. of turkey, cranberries, mashed potatoes,
oranges, and bananas. There were about 75 fine
cakes, 68 of which were sent from Lexington by Mrs.
Frances H. Beauchamp, Pres. W. C. T. U. The entire
dinner was well cooked and heartily enjoyed by all.</p>

<p>At 11:30, Bro. Jos. Severance, Chaplain, Bro. Geo.
L. Herr, of Louisville, Mrs. M. B. R. Day, of Frankfort,
and Miss Nellie E. Williams, Junior C. E. Superintendent,
of Maysville, entered, and took seats on the
stage; these are four of our truest and strongest
friends and are most heartily welcomed.</p>

<p>Bro. Severance opened the services by reading the
Christmas lesson, i. e., the 2nd chapter of Matthew,
which gives the most beautiful description of the birth
of the lowly Jesus.</p>

<p>Bro. Herr then offered a fervent prayer.</p>

<p>Bro. Severance' remarks were few; he is still grieving
over the loss of his two children, and simply said
that this Christmas had lost all of its charms for him,
for instead of feeling joyful, he felt sad all of to-day
and yesterday, and that we understood why, for instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of four little girls, he had only two. He felt
his inability to proceed further, and gave the meeting
over into the hands of Bro. Herr to conduct as he
saw fit, and catching an idea from the foregoing remarks,
Bro. Herr referred to the fact that years ago,
Christmas was very sad to him. That he was lying
in a saloon in the city of Louisville without friends
and without hope. Then in a jovial manner showed
by comparison what a difference then and now.</p>

<p>He then said: "I am so glad that Jesus said:
'Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out;
I am so glad that he is the same yesterday, to-day and
forever. He said: 'Follow me, and I will make you
fishers of men. There is not a man behind prison bars
that Jesus Christ cannot clean up and make him a
man."</p>

<p>The audience sat up and took notice when he mentioned
a man who had been a homeless wretch, and
a degraded sinner, who had spent thirty-two years
of his life behind prison bars, but had been converted
in the Louisville jail and was now a man of
God, the leader in a Rescue Mission in one of our
largest cities, and had the financial support of eight
of the wealthiest men in that city. He said that
whenever a man goes blind, or deaf, or is afflicted in
any other way, he is sent to a hospital for treatment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
and that this prison is a sort of hospital, and that
some of us are so blind that we cannot tell the difference
between our own and other peoples' horses. This
simile was put forth in such a humorous manner as
to cause much laughter.</p>

<p>He then launched into an earnest exhortation to
the men to do better. To quit their meanness, as Sam
Jones said. "Cease from evil and learn to do well."
That to quit one's evil ways was only half the duty,
and that the remainder consisted in doing the right
thing, and you may have this assurance that the man
who is serving the Lord will not get into trouble.
"An idle mind is the devil's work-shop." In this
connection he gave a very pretty illustration of how
one's energies are used in either the right way or
wrong way; that if you build a fire under a steam
boiler, place the proper quantity of water in it, and
then open the throttle and allow the steam to get into
the engine, the entire machinery will perform a good
work, but if you shut off the steam and tie down the
safety valve, the steam is going to exert itself in a
disastrous manner by an explosion, and the killing
of several men.</p>

<p>"The wages of sin is death, and if you can only
open your eyes and see that, you can also see that
"The gift of God is eternal life." The only way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
under heaven by which a man can be saved, is to
come over to the service of God and begin to do that
which is right.</p>

<p>Now what is the purpose of Christmas day? The
world has agreed that this is as near the birth of
Christ as we can possibly figure it; it means that 1907
years ago Jesus was born into the world, and the
star of Bethlehem came and stood over the place
where the young child lay; the angels sang "Glory
to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, good will
towards men," and we celebrate the day in memory
of that event.</p>

<p>What is the trouble to-day that causes all these
penitentiaries over our land; why all these jails and
the strong arm of the law? It is because men will
not allow the gospel of Jesus Christ to reign in their
hearts. As long as the children of Israel served the
Lord, they were happy and prosperous, but as soon
as they turned to the flesh pots of Egypt, they began
to despair and shame came upon them.</p>

<p>If you were asked what you would rather have
above all things, you would say, Just a piece of paper
with the great seal of the state impressed upon it, and
the signature of the Governor attached. Why? Because
prison life is a hard life and you are tired of
it. If I were a prisoner, I would want to make my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
confinement as pleasant as possible and I would become
converted immediately, for of all men on earth
the man in prison should be the quickest to accept
Jesus Christ. I would not want to be a prisoner all my
physical life, and then a spiritual prisoner throughout
eternity. Did it ever occur to you that hell must
be infinitely worse than it is pictured? We read of
a place "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is
not quenched." If this is a picture of hell, then
what must the reality be? There is a chance for every
man to get out of this prison, but there will be no
chance whatever to get out of hell.</p>

<p class="sub">Below appear but a few of the Hundreds of Letters we have
received from those Helped by Our Work</p>


<p>If you have asked the question, "Does it pay to
labor among the fallen ones in prison&mdash;are the results
from this work permanent in character?" let the answer
be found in these letters. They come from
writers' spontaneous offerings of gratitude, who have
been restored to society as useful respected citizens:</p>

<p style="margin-top:2em;">My Dearest Friend: It is very gratifying to find
myself alone long enough to pen you a few lines.</p>

<p>Arrived at 6:05 p.m. Well, I cannot tell you how
very pleased everyone was to see me. Went in at
once to see the president of a concern and told him
everything. He was entirely satisfied and told me
to commence work in the morning, which I did. They
all have used me fine, and I would never know I had
been away for no one mentions it. Brother, I think
of you fifty times a day, of the unselfish, never fatiguing
interest you manifested in my behalf, of the hundred
and one favors, and when I think that was only
a single factor in your work, I cannot but wonder
how you stand the strain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Cannot tell you how much I prize liberty, and I owe
having it, to a great extent, to your dear self. I assure
you your efforts and prayers of yourself and wife
for me done wonders. I have fully resolved to be a
good man.</p>

<p>Brother Herr, I am going to close, for I am going
to write to you every few days, as I consider you as
dear as an own brother. Give my sincere regards to
any inquiring friends. My heartiest to your dear
wife, and may God bless you both. I do.</p>

<p>The success that has attended the efforts of this
truly pious and angelic woman in her noble and heroic
work of rescuing sinful men and women from the vortex
of ruin and perdition is marvelous; and her labor
among the prisoners of the county jail is not less remarkable.
Mrs. Herr, unlike many religious workers,
realizes that before attempting to moralize with a
prisoner, his confidence must first be gained, and to
accomplish this she invariably succeeds in dispelling
that false and erroneous opinion so prevalent among
criminals, that they are held in contempt by society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and are considered undeserving of sympathy and assistance;
then, by kind and encouraging words and
gentle deed, instills, not by the dry and laborious way
of the brain, but into the heart, the story of the kind
and loving Saviour.</p>

<p>Like her contemporary, Mrs. Ballington Booth, Mrs.
Herr possesses that divinely urgent and persistent,
yet gentle and sympathetic spirit that can persuade
where others cannot convince; that can subdue where
others cannot conquer.</p>

<p>The writer of this article through her kind and encouraging
words, has been led from the error of his
way, and to take up again the thread laid down in
early years; has realized that though the fruitage of
the tragic and pathetic life that ended in the ignominious
death of Him who was the grandest character,
the most sublime ideal and the highest type of humanity
the world has ever seen&mdash;Jesus of Nazareth&mdash;we
can, if we come with faith and hope, be cleansed from
our sins and iniquities. May the Omnipotent God,
who holds the destiny of nations, pour out his blessings
upon this saintly woman and her noble hearted
husband and guide them through long and honored
days, and when the "shadows of even" gather and
the sun of life is setting, show them in the darkness
of the end, "words of light we never saw by day."</p>

<p class="sect"><a name="FISHING_FOR_MEN" id="FISHING_FOR_MEN"></a>FISHING FOR MEN.</p>


<p>Dear Brother Herr: We, as prisoners in the Jefferson
County Jail, desire, for your encouragement,
and because it is the spontaneous expression of our
hearts, to thank you for your continued, untiring and
unselfish devotion to our interests, spiritual and temporal.
We desire in this manner to show you and the
public that we thoroughly appreciate the efforts of
those who try to draw us from the broad road of vice
and crime into the narrow path of virtue where we are
satisfied alone peace and happiness can be found.
Many persons, Bro. Herr, who have attempted the
task of rescuing the fallen have become discouraged
and given up the work because they could see no good
resulting from their efforts. Those persons had not
the faith to continue their work and leave results with
God. A prisoner who was an inmate of this jail several
years ago recently found himself again an inmate,
and expressed surprise at the changed tone, as it
were, of the jail, and he laughingly asked if the world
was getting better, for he said the men now in jail
were more refined in their conversation, more unselfish
in their actions toward each other, and of a higher
moral tone generally. What this man said is undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
true, and it is the result of the efforts of yourself
and other Christian workers who do not become weary
in well-doing. But it is you, Brother Herr, whom we
especially desire to thank, because you are with us
daily and no day passes that you do not perform some
act of kindness for some one of our number, who, but
for you, would have no friend. That perfect man,
Jesus of Nazareth, has said, "by their fruits ye shall
know them," and it is by this standard we as prisoners
have measured you and have not found you
wanting. You have gained our confidence and we
have proved your sincerity and we love you, Brother
Herr, because you daily prove your love for us. Prisoners
are naturally inclined to suspect the sincerity of
those who profess an interest in their welfare, but
when once you gain their confidence they are teachable.</p>

<p>A London lawyer who wrote the tragedy "Ion"
makes one of his characters say, "It is but a little
thing to speak a word of kindness which by daily use
has almost lost its sense, but on the ear of him who
thought to die unmourned will fall like sweetest
music." Many are the words of kindness which daily
fall from your lips, by which we are soothed and
blessed, and we firmly believe that they do not fall
upon stony ground and that the good God will reward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
you in his own good time with a bountiful harvest
of redeemed lives.</p>

<p>Prison libraries are nearly always more or less poor,
indefinite sort of affairs, with a questionable lot of
reading matter, mostly paper-backs and second-hand
magazines, forming its contents. But the Jefferson
county jail has marked a departure from the routine
of prison life in the establishment of a library station
for its inmates.</p>

<p>This little institution is a remarkable affair. Mrs.
Chester Mayer is responsible for its organization.
Mrs. Mayer is a member of the visiting board at the
county jail, and noticing the absence of good reading
matter, the continual idling of prisoners, she took up
the matter with Jailer John R. Pflanz, who approved
the idea of a library station. Then she approached
her husband, Dr. Mayer, a member of the Board of
Trustees of the Louisville Free Public Library.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>When George T. Settle, the recently elected librarian,
was approached, he gave his hearty consent. One
hundred volumes were sent immediately for the men's
department and fifty for the women prisoners. The
books were selected by Miss Annie V. Pollard, former
acting librarian, who gave considerable time to a
study of the most desirable literature. The books sent
were non-denominational, nonpolitical, and mostly fiction,
works of the popular authors, but nothing too
heavy for the mental appetite of the inmates. The
books were taken from the open-shelf room.</p>

<p>As these books are used they are changed. Since
the establishment of the jail library station the circulation
has reached 2,000 books. Of course, the same
book is read by nearly all the regular borrowers.</p>

<p>An interesting sight is presented when the prisoners
are at liberty in the open places at the jail. About
75 per cent. of the prisoners can read. The other 25
per cent. gather about an appointed reader, who reads
aloud.</p>

<p>How much better is this for those unfortunates than
idling their time, brooding, planning evil deeds, perhaps,
or thinking criminal thoughts!</p>

<p>The Rev. George L. Herr, prison evangelist, is in
charge of the work and he and Jailer Pflanz have
made it a success.</p>

<p class="mag">[Courier-Journal]</p>


<p>Frankfort, Ky., March 14.&mdash;(Special.)&mdash;Although
he is serving two life sentences for murder, Curt Jett,
"the wild dog of the mountains," has not yet abandoned
hope of getting a pardon and being given another
chance to show that his reformation has been
sincere and final. He says that God has pardoned him
for his crimes and he thinks the Governor ought to.</p>

<p>"The best thing ever happened to me was when I
was sent to the penitentiary," said Jett last night in
his cell in the prison here as he was talking to some
newspaper men, who were inside the cellhouse for another
purpose than talking to Jett. "I realize that
I never would have been reformed but for being put
in here," continued Jett. "I only wish that they
would give me another chance to show that I really
have changed my ways."</p>


<p class="sect">License To Teach Sunday-School.</p>

<p>Jett showed the newspaper men who had stopped to
talk to him, when they saw him lying on his cot reading,
a certificate from the International Sunday-school
League entitling him to teach in a Sunday-school. He
was prouder of that than he ever was of his ability to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
shoot and he showed it with great pride. Jett recently
wrote out his religious experiences for the Rev. Geo.
L. Herr, the prison evangelist, and last night Jett
said he would give the story to the newspapers if Col.
E. E. Mudd, the prison warden, had no objections.
Col. Mudd was with the newspaper men and readily
consented to Jett giving out the story. He had written
it with a pencil and gave it to the newspaper men,
desiring that it be published.</p>

<p>Jett's cell is covered with pictures, most of them
selected with care as to their beauty, and he has shown
taste in arranging them. One of the newspaper men
remarked on the decorations in the cell last night and
Jett said:</p>

<p>"Yes, it cheers this cell up a little and makes it
brighter."</p>


<p class="sect">Expression On Face Changed.</p>

<p>Even the expression of Jett's face has changed and
he has none of that hard look that he used to wear.
He is bright and cheerful and Col. Mudd says there
is not a better prisoner in the penitentiary than Jett.
Col. Mudd said that he could not say that Jett's conversion
was genuine from a religious standpoint, but
he says Jett has certainly changed inside the prison.
The Rev. Joseph Severance, the prison chaplain, says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
that Jett is one of the best Bible scholars he ever saw
and knows more about the Bible than many earnest
church workers.</p>

<p>In his story which he gave out last night Jett freely
admits his guilt of the crimes that are charged against
him. He added, when he said that it was a good thing
that he had been put in the penitentiary:</p>

<p>"I do not mean that it was good to kill men."</p>

<p>He said that whisky was largely responsible for his
misdeeds and he wanted to do good now that he had
done so much harm. The following is Jett's story as
he wrote it in his cell:</p>


<p class="sect">Jett's Story.</p>

<p>"State Prison, Frankfort, Ky., March 13, 1909.&mdash;To
the Whole World: I want to let the whole world
know what God in his great mercy has done for me,
and prove to you by words which are true that Jesus
is willing, able and does save to the uttermost. After
a life of sin and shame, God sent his Holy Spirit into
my soul and made a new man out of me. It was in
this wise: A dear, good woman who is dead now, but
who then lived in Lexington; her name was Mrs.
Fanny A. Penn&mdash;I shall never forget that name&mdash;she
wrote me a good Christian letter, full of good advice,
and begged me to become a Christian. I had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
seen her, or she me, as I know of; she had only read
in the press regarding what a desperado and outlaw I
was. I read her letter and it sounded like a fairy tale
to me, with no sense in it; but after reflection, I answered
it, and we began to be good friends, and she
kept begging me to turn from my sinful ways and be
a Christian man.</p>


<p class="sect">Read New Testament.</p>

<p>"I want to state right here that because a man is in
prison, he don't have to be a Christian or behave himself;
and Mrs. Penn sent me a small revised Testament
and begged me to read it. At first I laid it up and
would not read it. I don't remember of ever reading
a whole chapter in a Bible up until that time in my
whole life; and at last, by her begging me in every letter
to read my Testament, I began to read it, and
started out with a resolution to read it through, and
after I began to read, I became interested in it, and
the more I read it the deeper I became interested in it,
and God's Holy Spirit began to work in me, and I began
to pray. At first it seemed that I was afraid that
God would not answer my prayers, but still something
made me pray anyway, and it wasn't long until I was
praying to God every night from one to three times,
from the depths of my heart. I had taken his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
in vain ever since I was a child, and I asked him to
make me quit taking his name in vain, and after a
day at my work, and when I would curse God, I would
think of my prayers, and then at night when I would
go to my cell, I would let my thoughts wander over a
day that had just passed, and I could tell after reflecting
that I hadn't cursed so much that day. And
little by little God removed that evil spirit, cursing,
from me, until one night when I went to my cell and
my thoughts wandered over the day that had just
passed, and not an oath had I uttered, and I was happier
than ever before, I fell on my knees on the hard
stone floor, and thanked God for His goodness and for
removing that swearing away from me.</p>


<p class="sect">Quits Smoking Cigarettes.</p>

<p>"I had smoked cigarettes for at least fifteen years
and I quit them. I was full of revenge and hatred,
and I cried aloud to God in my lonely cell to redeem
my soul, which He did, and it wasn't long before I
was a friend to everyone and praising God for full
and free salvation. He has made a new man out of
me. The Holy Spirit is like a fever, and it is all and
all before a man gets right with God. Condemning
and deceitful spirits will rise up in a man, but all we
have to do is to ask God and he will remove them all;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
to live a true Christian life is the straightest life that
anyone ever tried to walk. It is a great warfare. I
read and study my Bible and have learned a great
deal about God's word since I joined the church, a few
short months ago, under a great, good and noble man
of Frankfort by the name of C. R. Hudson, and I love
him as a very dear brother. There is not a man in all
this world that I hold the least bit of malice against,
and before I got right with God I had revenge in me
against many.</p>


<p class="sect">Warns Young Men.</p>

<p>"Young men, as you read this, from one who has
done many and great wrongs, take warning; shun evil
companions and don't do as I have done in days gone
by. Don't be led astray by older heads, for the man
that will advise you to do a wrong is not your friend;
but I could not see it that way. God has given me a
new mind and I know as well as I know that I am living
that religion is true, real and no fake, as I once
thought.</p>


<p class="sect">Has Been Born Again.</p>

<p>"I was raised on a Bluegrass farm in Madison
County, Kentucky, and my parents were as good a
father and mother as ever lived; but my father died
while I was young and I went from bad to worse, committing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
crime after crime, and I am guilty of the
charges against me, but God has forgiven me of every
wrong I ever did. Why won't the Governor? All the
punishment that I will ever have to go through with
will be on this earth, for God has forgiven me of every
wrong and I have a clear conscience now, for I have
been born again. There are so many men in prison
that trample the lowly God under foot to try and gain
their freedom in that way, and I hope that no one
single person that reads this will think that I am
making mockery of God's love, for I am sincere with
God, as I used to be with Satan. I wish that every
paper in the whole world would publish this so that
it could have a chance to touch the hearts of many sinful
men; I long to tell the story to young men, from
East to West, from North to South, how God redeemed
my soul.</p>


<p class="sect">Refers to Scriptures.</p>

<p>"We have organized a Bible reading circle here in
the prison which is a grand and good work. Now I
refer you to some Scripture which I hope everyone
will read carefully, and it will show you how God
will forgive a man for the crime of murder and for all
crimes except one.</p>

<p>"Read Exodus ii., 11, 12, 13, 14, 15; II. Samuel xi.
and xii.; Ezekiel xviii., from 20th verse to end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>

7; 16, 17, 22; Galatians iii., 24.</p>

<p>"I ask for the sincere prayers of every good Christian
in this whole world; pray for me, that I may be
true to God the rest of my life. When I was repenting
my whole face would draw and I could feel the
hot, burning love of God in my whole being. I am in
prison, maybe never to hear the birds sing or the rippling
of the water again, a free man, but I say unto
you that I am a free man in Jesus; I have found a
friend that sticks closer than a brother. People, let
your light shine, for I believe that there are many diamonds
in the rough. I am yours in Jesus,</p>

than Henry E. Youtsey.</p>
</div>

<p>When I commenced my life sentence here, February
6th, 1901, I fell in love with our Christian Endeavor
Society at first sight, and in all those 104
months I have only missed about 15 meetings, due to
unavoidable causes. I was ill for three months with
malaria and could not go at all.</p>

<p>During the early days of my imprisonment our
membership at its best averaged about 100, but during
the summer months when the boys were given their
choice between the open air of the yard and attendance
at the meetings the average was less than 20.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1905, and at the instance of Mrs.
M. B. R. Day, of Frankfort, I organized and managed
a memorizing contest in which a number of prisoners
learned and recited verses of scripture, and I
obtained a number of handsome Teachers' Bibles and
other presents which were given to them as prizes on
Thanksgiving day. I continued this work for the
three following summers, and in all forty-five prisoners
learned and recited a grand total of 33,332 verses,
(over four times as many as are contained in the New
Testament), which is an average of 741 verses per
man. The men studied so hard that some of them injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
their eyes, and it was thought best to discontinue
the work for a while.</p>

<p>I was Corresponding Secretary of our Society for
about two and one-half years, and last December I
was elected its President by the largest majority ever
given any candidate for the office.</p>

<p>I started in to raise our membership to two hundred,
and succeeded in getting it as high as one hundred
and sixty-six. It was also my desire to have better
attendance during the hot months, and I used
every means I could think of to make our meetings
attractive, and I was frequently both pleased and
surprised to count from sixty-five to seventy, more
than three times what it used to be. Some of our
members being delicate are in great need of all the
fresh air they can get and remain in the yard all day
Sundays in pretty weather although their hearts are
with us.</p>

<p>A part of our pledge binds the members to carefully
read the Bible every day, and I wondered how
they were going to keep that pledge without the Bibles,
so I set to work again writing letters in every
direction, and almost before I knew it our Ky. C. E.
Societies sent us 50 Bibles, and Miss Mary B. Rohrer,
of Franklin, Pa., sent me 150 of the prettiest Bibles
you ever saw; they have flexible, over-lapping backs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
red-under-gold edges, maps, and other helps. This
is the most magnificent present we have ever received
from outside parties, and besides all these, the
Prison Commissioners offered us 100 more, which we
could not use. One thing that has impressed me very
forcibly is the fact that the Christian people outside
are ready at all times to shower blessings upon us,
and all we have to do is to ask for them.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of Bro. Jos. Severance, our splendid
Chaplain, I numbered the Bibles and gave them
out to the members, keeping a careful record of them,
and the men were instructed to return the Bibles to
the Society on leaving the prison, and although about
a score of our members have gone out since then we
have only lost one Bible, which speaks volumes for
their honesty.</p>

<p>A few Sundays ago I proposed that the Society set
apart a small sum of money for prizes, and that all
the members who wished to do so would be invited
to write compositions on the subject, "What Christian
Endeavor has done for me." Nine brothers entered
this symposium, and their compositions signed,
"Amo Rolo, Sunflower, Rhododendron, Laurel, Merry
Heart, Happy Bird, Mizpah, and Christian, aggregate
about 7,500 words, and make fine reading; Bro.
Severance was appointed Judge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>This summer I organized a little band of workers
who go with me to the hospital every Sunday, where
we hold little services of song, prayer and Bible reading
at the bedsides of those who are ill, and I have
found great joy in this work.</p>

<p>We have had some splendid C. E. meetings, the best
ones being those when the Senior and Junior societies
of the Frankfort Christian Church and the Epworth
League of the Methodist Church united with
us. Of course, we could not go to them, but they came
to us, and gave us rare spiritual and intellectual
treats. The music was specially beautiful.</p>

<p>Quite recently I assisted Bro. Severance in re-organizing
a Bible class, of which I am Secretary. We
are studying Moninger's "Training for Service," and
have 52 members. Splendid progress is being made.
So you see my hands are pretty full, and when Sunday
night comes I am about ready to drop in my
tracks. Of course, it is all voluntary, and I do not
have to turn my hand over if I do not want to.</p>

<p>I am going to add a "Soul-winners Department"
to our C. E. Society for the purpose of assisting Bro.
Severance in the conversion of the men, but I am in
some doubt as to how to proceed as there is no chance
to get at the men in the winter time. However, I am
determined to find opportunity somehow.</p>

<p>We have a new Superintendent of Prison C. E.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
work, in the person of Miss Georgia Dunn, of Marksbury,
Ky. She is the most energetic little Christian
lady I have seen in a long time, and our society will
surely hum this winter under her guidance, as we
are all very proud of our good little sister.</p>

<p>January 1st, I commenced to read my Bible
through, at the rate of three chapters each week night,
and five each Sunday night, in order to get through
by December 31st, but I read more than that and finished
up three months ahead of time. Although I
have read the good book constantly during the last
eight years, this is the first continuous reading to
completion that I ever did.</p>

<p>I have enjoyed Bro. Severance's sermons very much
and I believe there is nothing that thrills and inspires
me with enthusiasm like fine preaching, and right
here I am going to tell you something which you must
keep under your hat; one Sunday Bro. Severance was
unexpectedly called away, and asked for a volunteer
to fill his place, and I was delighted at the opportunity,
and although I could not fill it I "rattled about
in it," for about 30 minutes, and one dear fellow accepted
the gospel invitation and joined the church.
As soon as my sermonette was over quite a number of
friends crowded around me and showered congratulations
on me. This was a temptation to try again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and the next time three brothers joined the church,
and that pleased me immensely, you know.</p>

<p>I have many good friends in Louisville, including
Dr. Powell, of the Christian Church; Dr. T. M. Hawes,
of the Highland Presbyterian Church, whose C. E.
Society sent us $7.50, and, say, there is a pastor after
God's own heart. Give them all my love when you see
them, and say to them that while I am ashamed of
the sins that brought me here I am trying to leave
foot-prints that I will be proud of in the great day of
judgment.</p>

<p>The Christian Endeavor Societies of Newport,
Paris, Winchester and Lexington have helped us wonderfully.
Lexington is the principal center of Christian
Endeavor activity, from my point of view, and
I have an especially warm place in my heart for
those societies.</p>

<p>How is Mr. John R. Pflanz getting along? He is
another whom I love, and I hope that he will get
every office that he goes after.</p>

<p>Be sure and give my kindest regards to your most
excellent wife; she is certainly a queen among women.</p>

<p>Trusting that I have not tired you, and that you
will excuse my remissness in failing to write sooner,</p>

<h2><a name="Capital_Punishment" id="Capital_Punishment"></a>Capital Punishment</h2>


<p>The following forceful expressions regarding capital
punishment by Gov. Geo. W. Hunt, of Arizona, are
in exact keeping with the thoughts of the author.
"Thou shalt not kill" applies to governments, corporations,
societies and individuals alike.</p>

<p>Capital punishment is simply the commission by the
State of an act which is regarded as a horrible crime
if committed by an individual. One man must not
kill another man, but several men vested with official
titles can hold a conference and send a soul to eternity.
The State says: "You must not kill; but if you
do, I will kill you." This theory of a State's power
or duty owes its origin to the lowest class of barbarians
in the early history of the world. Their logic, if
it may be called that, sprang solely from a spirit of
revenge. The idea that a legal execution would deter
others from committing murder probably never occurred
to them. Their crude minds did not rise above
the thought that the victim should be avenged, and
that adequate vengeance could be found only in the
hangman's noose or the guillotine.</p>

<p>There are a thousand other practices originating
with barbarians which the footsteps of civilization and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
progress have crushed. But capital punishment, the
worst heritage of the dark ages, lingers with us, betraying
one of the spots in humanity where the veneer
of civilization is thin. I am inclined to think that the
spirit of revenge still is the ruling motive back of the
legal execution, even though pleas are made in its behalf
which barbarians never thought of. They could
not very well think of such punishment as a curb to
more murders, for even they could not help seeing
that the beheading and quartering of offenders had no
such effect. The legal execution has no such effect today,
a fact which any fair-minded man will recognize
after proper investigation. And if that plea falls
down, as it does and must continue to do, what defense
of the legal killing of our fellowman is left us?
The moment we are convinced that the number of
murders is on the increase, or does not decrease, in
spite of the rope and electric chair, we will have to
justify capital punishment on some other ground.
What is that other ground, if it is not the old savage
impulse of meting revenge&mdash;a species of revenge,
at the last analysis, confers no good whatever upon
society as a whole, and is of no consolation or comfort
to the family circle most affected by the original murder?</p>

<p>Arizona has taken most advanced ground upon
social and economic questions, and while the old territorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
law, permitting capital punishment, is still on
the statute books, it must be remembered that statehood
has been in operation less than a year, and that
the first State Legislature was overwhelmed with work
during the comparatively short session prescribed by
the Constitution. I am confident that public sentiment
in Arizona is opposed to capital punishment.
During the special session of the Legislature, which
will be held early in 1913, an effort will be made to repeal
the old law. If the Legislature is too busy to give
the matter attention, or is disinclined to assume the responsibility,
the initiative provision of the State Constitution
will be invoked, thus putting the question
square up to the people. I have no fears for the outcome.
Arizona citizenship has proved itself too intelligent
to lag behind the advanced thought and progress
of civilization.</p>

<h2><a name="Indiana_Reformatory" id="Indiana_Reformatory"></a>Indiana Reformatory</h2>

<p class="sub">Inmates Subscribe for Pipe Organ</p>


<p>Each one a Carnegie in proportion to his ability to
give, a majority of the 1,204 inmates of the Indiana
Reformatory yesterday voluntarily contributed toward
the purchase of a pipe organ for the handsome
chapel of the institution, the total offerings approximated
$900. When the contribution cards were
checked up by the Rev. W. E. Edgin, chaplain of the
reformatory, he was surprised at the generosity shown
by the inmates. The individual sums given ranged
from 25 cents to $35.</p>

<p>When Gov. J. Frank Hanly was a guest at the Reformatory
recently he was asked by Mr. Edgin as to
the best plan to pursue to get from Andrew Carnegie
a contribution sufficient to buy a pipe organ. Gov.
Hanly replied that this sum could be raised in Indiana,
and he started the list with $100. It then occurred
to Mr. Edgin to ask voluntary contributions
from the inmates, and permission was given by Supt.
Whittaker. Cards were left in each cell, with blanks
for subscriptions, but it was distinctly stated that all
offerings should be entirely voluntary. A great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of the inmates bring money with them to the Reformatory,
and this, with that which they earn by overtime
work, which is considerable, is credited to them.</p>

<p>When the success of the offering was learned the inmates
were as much pleased as Chaplain Edgin. The
new organ soon will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>To neglect, reject or doubt the Bible in any particular
is but an entering wedge to spiritual apathy. The
"Bible tinkers" of this or any other age have been
men whose hearts are cold and whose soul saving powers
were limited.</p>

<p>To obey the Bible, will lead to a perfect salvation,
make possible a victorious faith, surmount the difficulties
of life and gain an "inheritance incorruptible,
and undefiled and that fadeth not away, reserved in
heaven for you."</p>

<p>Watson says, "The Bible is a rock of diamonds; a
chain of pearls; the sword of the Spirit, a chart by
which the Christian sails to eternity, the map by
which he daily walks; the sun dial by which he sets
his life; the balance by which he weighs his actions."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Dear Friend&mdash;Our country is taxed with a burden
of thousands of prisoners. These people are crippled,
not in body, not in mind, but almost always in morals,
which is the most serious. It is to help or recover
them that we are giving our lives. Our labors have
not been in vain, as the testimonials will show you.
We want you to "hold the rope while we go down into
the pit," by subscribing for our support and transportation
in this work of prison evangelism; and in so
doing you become the benefactor of a submerged class.</p>

<p>May we not hope to have your check to help in this
concerted effort? I am,</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
